VWhat\u2019s up Reddit? I thought my "little" crypto guide could be of use to some of you. Feel free to reach out if you have questions.\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a> **TL;DR:** *Use this guide to gain an edge over the market. Focus on the essentials and apply the tools described in the following intelligently. Don\u2019t make investing into cryptocurrencies and trading in general too complicated. Apply the KISS method, eliminate what doesn\u2019t work and focus on continuously increasing your efficiency/ROI. Use boring market phases to further develop your skill set and plan entries in undervalued projects. Gain access to the best information sources possible (see below) and develop a good understanding of the current market sentiment. Adapt flexibly to changing market circumstances, ideally by having a variety of investing/trading strategies at your disposal. Develop a feeling for what works under present market circumstances and leave out all the rest until the market changes.*\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000aThe following guide condenses everything I found helpful in gaining an edge over the market. It is, however, by no means intended to be exhaustive; there\u2019s always something new to be learned. Similarly, this guide heavily draws on everything I\u2019ve learned from my mentors. As I was standing on the shoulders of giants, I do not claim to be the original inventor/discoverer of all of this. It also draws heavily from Dr. Steve Brule\u2019s brilliant ideas whom I was privileged enough to get to know. Thank you for everything \u2013 you know who you are.\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a#My Comprehensive Crypto Guide \u2013 Beating the Market 101\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000aTo do well in crypto you should first and foremost understand the \u201cbasics.\u201d Once you have covered these, you can gradually advance your level of proficiency. The first part of this guide covers the rough essentials, skip this if you are already pretty experienced. The second part will go into more detail on the advanced strategies.\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a##General rules for crypto investing and trading (the obvious \u201cbasics\u201d)\u000a\u000a**A. Don\u2019t get overly complicated:** Focus on swing trades or long-term holds instead of forcefully trying to day trade. A large percentage that gets into day trading will lose money because of it. Similarly, apply the 80/20 rule (Pareto principle) to discover what works best for you / is most profitable and eliminate all the rest.\u000a\u000a**B. Before entering the markets, always check BTC first:** The entire crypto market is heavily dependent on the price movement of BTC. Knowing how it is moving is essential for understanding how alts behave.\u000a\u000a**C. Don\u2019t try to predict the market, react to it:** A quick look into the trading ideas section of Trading View will show you that even the TA experts have a tough time in trying to predict market movements. Instead of trying to forecast movements, focus on trading and investing strategies that flexibly react to the market.\u000a\u000a**D. Do not FOMO into all-time highs:** If you come across an exciting project that is being hyped right now and has already pumped significantly, close your chart and wait for the correction. Set yourself an alert (for instance by using Coinigy. com) for a more reasonable price level and act accordingly once the alert is triggered.\u000a\u000a**E. Cut your losses early but don\u2019t sell at all-time lows:** Ideally you are cutting your losses early on at around 5-10%, depending on your trading/investment strategy. Doing so will help you to prevent selling at local lows. If you didn\u2019t follow this essential rule and are down considerably, consider taking the hit and further holding it \u2013 if you profoundly believe in the projects fundamentals. You might have to ignore such a bag for a couple of months or even years but you won\u2019t be one of those who sold BTC at $50 because of a 45% correction. Similarly, it takes nerves of steel not to sell into a dump. Develop the necessary patients to enter and exit during the most profitable moments.\u000a\u000a**F. Take profits:** Take profits early on to increase your profitability and make it a habit to take your principal investment out as soon as you have reached your targets. From this point on, you can either decide to let your \u201cfree\u201d coins ride or you can invest at a later stage once the correction is over. There always is a correction. Make sure not to get too greedy. It\u2019s better to sell at a 5-30% profit rather than hoping for unrealistic gains. \u000a\u000a**G. Not entering a trade is the best decision in ~70% of all cases** Try to eliminate investment/trading decisions that are based on emotions. Leave out emotions in general. Have the patience to wait for good entry points. Let the market come to you. Don\u2019t trade because you\u2019re bored. Less is definitely more when it comes to trading. Higher trading activity does not necessarily equal more profits.\u000a\u000a**H. Know your risk:** If you are entering a trade without having defined your risk-to-reward ratio, you will lose money in the long haul. If you know the amount of money you are willing to risk in advance, there will be no emotional decisions and no surprises.\u000a\u000a**I. Avoid staring at charts all day:** This is perhaps the most common source for bad trades. Relentlessly staring at your charts will lead you to become impatient, which in turn makes you come up with all kinds of \u201csignals\u201d that justify entering a bad position.\u000a\u000a**J. Learn the basics of technical analysis (TA):** There is no excuse for not knowing at least the fundamentals of TA. Even if you intend to enter long-term positions, it will greatly increase your ROI. It is a useful tool in your arsenal, use it. \u201cExperts\u201d telling you that TA does not work do so under the presumption that TA most work 100% of all the time, which it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s an exceptionally helpful tool \u2013 among other valuable instruments. More on TA later.\u000a\u000a**K. Margin trading is a quick way to lose your money:** Don\u2019t let stagnating market activity lure you into margin trading. If you have reasonable success with your investing/trading strategy, start with a maximum of 2-5x leverage. Anyone telling you to go beyond 10x is either a trading genius or out of his mind. In general, high leverage margin trading is gambling and nothing else, especially on manipulated exchanges.\u000a\u000a**L. Use limit orders:** Don\u2019t waste money on trading fees and potential profits by market buying. Set limit orders at attractive price levels and have the patience to wait long enough until your order is filled.\u000a\u000a**M. Understand the nature of stop/loss orders:** Crypto is a heavily manipulated market. Manipulators will try to trigger your S/L orders. For this reason, use them sparingly and only when you are unable to follow the market.\u000a\u000a**N. Never marry a project:** There appears to be a pretty intensive rivalry between numerous crypto projects. I\u2019m not a fan boy so I don\u2019t really care whether VET is better than WTC or not \u2013 I profited from both of them. Ask yourself if you want to be an investor or a fan. There\u2019s no problem with being both as long as it does not cloud your judgment.\u000a\u000a**O. Psychology:** Understand your own and the market participant\u2019s psychology. Keep emotions out of the equation. Don\u2019t panic during a panic sell \u2013 that\u2019s what everyone else does. Instead, apply the most effective strategies or countermeasures during these unexpected market events, for example QFL-style trading (which will be covered later on). Cut your losses once the recovery happens later on. If you closely look at the charts, you will see that dumps of solid projects are usually followed by short-term recoveries that help you to exit with less losses.\u000a\u000a**P. Market manipulation:** Due to lacking oversight and regulations, crypto markets are the most manipulated markets you can possibly invest in. The majority of price action results from whales or their bots playing with you or with each other. It\u2019s not unusual to encounter manipulators that try to get you to FOMO or panic sell so that they can either dump upon you or buy at cheaper levels. To succeed in this game, most investors are best off when buying pre-FOMO while the market is still low. The shorter the time frame of your holding period, the more affected you will be by price manipulation.\u000a\u000a**Q. Buy low sell high:** Find attractive entries when the charts show sideways price action or flat price floors. The most dangerous time to invest is during a pump or FOMO rally. Have the patience to miss out on coins that have already gone parabolic if you want to avoid becoming a bag holder.\u000a\u000a**R. Sell in May and go away (sort of):** The period from October to December is seasonally exceptionally strong \u2013 not just in the stock markets (since 1896 strength pattern Oct-Dec observable) but also when it comes to BTC. Similarly, June to September isn\u2019t that attractive. Be sure to keep these historical patterns in mind \u2013 especially when you decide to trade against them. The probability to lose money while trading against the pattern is higher than to make money. At the same time, in stocks you have more market bottoms occurring in October than in other months. In short, this does not mean you need to exit all markets during specific time periods but it could be helpful to know which pattern has a higher probability of playing out.\u000a\u000a**S. Beware of traps:** Market manipulators may use an accumulation of bullish setups or too much attention on a key breakout area to shake out / trap a large portion of traders. Keep this in mind when you see setups that are too good to be true.\u000a\u000a**T. Accept that the market is smarter than you:** Adapt to the fact that the market is smarter and more resourceful than you are. There\u2019s no point in trying to force your will on the market. Similarly, the market is able to forecast important events astonishingly well ahead of time. When the news breaks, it is more than likely that the information is already priced in.\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a##Technical analysis\u000aTA is predictive not definitive. Most people make the mistake of assuming that TA is 100% accurate (it is not). Once they figure that out, they quickly become disappointed and stop using it altogether. Don\u2019t be like the masses. Incorporate TA intelligently into your comprehensive crypto arsenal. Ignore it at your own risk but don\u2019t become overly dependent on it.  It is an effective tool if applied correctly. Use TA to identify up/downtrends, support and resistance lines as well as the most common and most effective price patterns. Use this information to identify lucrative entry and exit points. \u000aYou don\u2019t need to be a TA crack to succeed. The beauty with cryptos is that you can be pretty successful with a basic understanding of TA and a selection of the most powerful indicators/oscillators at your hand. \u000a\u000a**Focus on identifying support/resistance lines as well as order blocks and make use of volume, trendlines, RSI, sRSI, MFI, Fibonacci extensions/retracements & Bollinger bands. Developing a reasonable understanding of these TA tools will cover you in 99% of all cases.** You can include MACD and Ichimoku clouds. Elliott waves aren\u2019t that reliable in my opinion.\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a**1.** Every chart tells a story. Learn to read it. Have a look at the volume. Is the volume justifying the current price movement? In general, a pump without volume will most likely not be supported for too long (i.e. prices will dump shortly after). Similarly, a tiny candlestick in combination with a huge spike in volume is a telltale sign of a reversal. Another interesting sign is rapidly increasing volume while prices remain stagnant over some period of time.\u000a\u000a**2.** Focus on the most effective indicators and the most effective trading patterns. Don\u2019t just blindly rely on indicators that the next random guy on Twitter recommends. Be scientific about your approach. Use only those particular indicators that work the best. Indicator back testing with market data from almost 15 years by Emerald Summit highlights a couple of excellent and highly successful indicators/oscillators: \u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a+ RSI (Relative Strength Index): most successful indicator of the study\u000a+ RMI (Relative Momentum Index): generates profits with long positions. Not for the short term\u000a+ MFI (Money Flow Index): indicator is beating the benchmark with long positions\u000a+ sRSI/Stochastics: outperforms the benchmark but not always profitable\u000a+ BB (Bollinger Bands): outperforms benchmark for five-day swing trading\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a*Ineffective indicators are:*\u000a\u000a+ SMA (Simple Moving Average): results are worse than random trading => useless\u000a+ EMA (Exponential Moving Average): generates substantial losses\u000a+ CCI (Commodity Channel Index): generates losses\u000a+ MACD (Moving Average Convergence-Divergence): low levels of successfulness\u000a+ TRIXS: generates losses\u000a+ Parabolic SAR: poor results\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000aCMO wasn\u2019t tested but I like it as well. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily exclude SMAs/EMAs because of these results \u2013 they are still valid for identifying support and resistance levels.\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a**3.** Compare a chart\u2019s different time frames. Start with the daily timeframe and work yourself towards the shorter time frames. In general, it\u2019s not a good idea to enter positions without checking multiple time frames first. The daily chart gives you an excellent overview. 1h-4h time frames are excellent for entering swing positions. 5m-15m should only be used for discovering the optimal entry/exit points, if it all. Anything below 1h is not going to be of much help to the majority of traders/investors. In case you\u2019re **tired of clicking through all the time frames on Trading View**: *I am using crafty bots on Discord to help me check the various time frames at a glance. Invite link to access my Discord crypto dashboard so that you can use these bots for free can be found at the bottom of this guide.*\u000a\u000a**4.** Develop your TA skills by actively drawing charts and/or monitoring indicators. Share your strategies with like-minded and experienced individuals and listen to their feedback. Do some back testing to improve your accuracy and to identify mistakes.\u000a\u000a**5.** Learn from the pros by reading or watching their TA analysis. More on this later on.\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a##Market information and signals\u000aInformation is key. Gain access to a stream of quickly accessible and high-quality crypto information sources or signals. Differentiate between information for the masses (mainstream media etc.) and information for the classes to filter out the former. Professionals in this area do not rely on news narratives for their decision-making. Instead, they look at the hard facts, price action, a project\u2019s fundamentals etc. Use the information streams you have available to develop a feeling for the current market sentiment. At the beginning, I was switching from Reddit to Twitter to YouTube to Telegram to Medium in combination with email/SMS alerts and a couple of other services, which is quite tiresome.\u000a\u000aLater on, I\u2019ve built my personal crypto dashboard on Discord where I have everything in one place \u2013 from all the Twitter influencers and YouTubers to the most helpful indicators, bots and signals. I\u2019ve created specific Discord channels for each influencer/signal provider. New posts are highlighted, so I no longer have to check all the different platforms. I rarely leave Reddit/Discord these days. Saves me a lot of time and helps me to focus on what is really important: making investment and trading decisions. \u000a\u000aOriginally, I was using the dashboard that I\u2019ve built only by myself but a couple of my trading friends convinced me of opening it up to them and others. You can **build your own Discord crypto dashboard if you\u2019re technically skilled or join our community**, invite link can be found at the end of this guide. Discord has become a crucial aspect of my crypto journey so I would recommend anyone to look into it and to possibly build such a dashboard for yourself if you are inclined to do so and have the necessary time for it.\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a**1.** Twitter influencers: In general, Crypto Twitter is highly irrational, short-term oriented and either obsessively bullish or pessimistically bearish. Be prepared to get manipulated. I skim through the tweets of a couple Twitter personalities (~ 5 mins) to quickly gain a feeling for the market sentiment. Amongst them are Edward Morra, zyzz, ThinkingUSD, Gordon Crypto, Crypto Rand, Crypto Cred, Eric Choe, Cryptodonald, Peter Brandt, Trace Mayer and Coffee. Twitter is excellent for gaining a microscopic (!) perspective on the present market conditions. We\u2019ll use other tools for the macro perspective. Filter drama and unnecessary discussions/comments as much as possible. Create a Twitter list with your most favorite influencers or use Discord to integrate them all in one place like I do, which has the advantage that you can filter out replies/comments and retweets.\u000a\u000a**2.** YouTubers: YT is excellent to familiarize yourself with the different approaches and methodologies of experienced investors/traders. Next to Twitter, YouTube adds a broader and more nuanced perspective to your market information arsenal. The analysis you can find on YT is more detailed and less opinionated. I like Alessio Rastani, Josh Olszewicz, Tradedevil and The Chart Guys. Quickfingers Luc is excellent for QFL-style trading. \u201cIn it for the Money\u201c is a great microcap picker during bull markets. Philakone has useful tutorials for daytrading and swing trading but I don\u2018t trust him. Crypto Cred has great tutorials as well. Watch videos at 1.5x speed or faster. Know that certain influential YouTubers have been caught in market manipulating activities. Use YouTube subscription alerts to get a notification when a new video has been released. Discord is also excellent for following these YouTube influencers without clustering your YouTube feed.\u000a\u000a**3.** Telegram: Some excellent analysts can be found on Telegram. This medium allows you to add a more detailed perspective on the markets to your portfolio \u2013 generally with a longer timeframe in mind. I found the market analysis by Bitcoin Bravado and CC insider to be pretty useful. Alan Masters has an interesting channel as well. There are some more like CryptoSamurai1, cryptocue, cryptobullet and coinguru1113 but the former two should have you covered in the beginning. You can pin around five Telegram channels in the app. If that isn\u2019t enough for you (it isn\u2019t for me), I highly recommend using Discord even though this one is a bit more difficult to set up. Let me know if you need help.\u000a\u000a**4.** Long/Short: The Long-Short ratio gives you a good feeling of the market sentiment. If the majority of traders are long, it indicates bullish tendencies in the market. Similarly, sudden changes in the ratio indicate changing sentiments. In general, when short interest hits local highs (or even record highs), it\u2019s an indication that we are close to the bottom. You can use Trading View to compare the charts. I found it easier and faster to simply use the margin-bots that I have available in Discord, they show me percentage changes in the Long-Short ratio so I can directly compare both instead of skipping from one chart to the other.\u000a\u000a**5.** Mainstream media: CNBC\u2019s Fast Money is an excellent counter indicator. If you don\u2019t believe me, compare price action after bearish/bullish tweets. You\u2019ll be surprised at the accuracy of this counter indicator. As a general rule of thumb, mainstream news sources are intended for the masses not for the classes. Both extremes of public opinion (excessively bearish or bullish) are contrarian signals for us. Extreme pessimism can (!) be a bullish sign and extreme optimism can (!) be a warning sign. It is one signal that we need to factor in with other hard facts.\u000a\u000a**6.** Cryptocurrency calendars: coinmarketcal. com and cryptocalendar.pro are useful to check upcoming events of a variety of different projects. I have them all in one channel and skim through it regularly. Usually, the market behaves according to the principle \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d meaning that many investors will take profit once the news has broken. Be prepared to get dumped upon at the announcement of the news, for instance a mainnet launch whose date was publicized long before. The following correction is a great opportunity to buy the dip btw.\u000a\u000a**7.** News aggregators: cryptopanic. com is excellent for skimming the most important headlines. It may be a good idea to aggregate a couple of sources to prevent bias.\u000a\u000a**8.** Tether print alerts: Newly printed Tether and the movement of large sums of it indicate or at least hint at significant market activity in the short term.\u000a\u000a**9.** TradingView trading ideas: I\u2019ve created my own channels for the top 10 cryptocurrency analysts on TradingView. It should also be possible to receive their latest trading ideas by following them on TradingView but that\u2019s not my preferred way of doing it. I found it helpful to read through their trading ideas and to read their opinions. Try to profile each trader and categorize their ideas/recommendations accordingly. Some are great at market analysis while others have interesting short-term trading ideas.\u000a\u000a**10.** Reddit/4chan/Medium: Not much needs to be said about this point. Filter out the garbage and use the occasional pieces of gold to your advantage. I\u2019ve got feeds for each of the three. To put it bluntly, I don\u2019t care about a rivalry between the individual platforms and who thinks is smarter or who has the better users. There will always be personal preferences not only on the three mentioned above but also on YouTube, Twitter, telegram, twitch etc. Every source has its advantages and shortcomings.\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a## Learning materials\u000a\u000aThere\u2019s always something new you can learn. Use boring market periods to hone your skills.\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a**1.** Take the free trading course at babypips. com/learn/forex. It is centered on forex but also applies to crypto as well. If you\u2019re short on time, follow the program at least to the \u201cundergraduate freshman\u201d level.\u000a\u000a**2.** DataDash has created some excellent instruction videos for learning the basics of TA and fundamental analysis. Go through his videos at 1.5x speed. Beginner level: youtube. com/watch?v=RQtvpNYtLfw, Intermediate: youtube. com/watch?v=pYWdrn3JD40 and Advanced: youtube. com/watch?v=zBjbyew6oyc\u000a\u000a**3.** CryptoCred\u2019s technical analysis lessons are pretty helpful as well: Google document with his lessons: docs.google. com/document/d/15c3rN15rkXldY8Te3GDG4NG7noaaoikydOoZQlElwXw/preview\u000a\u000a**4.** Books help you to increase your understanding of market dynamics. Essential reading materials are:\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a+ Mark Douglas: Trading in the Zone & The Disciplined Trader (psychological preparation)\u000a+ Jack D. Schwager: Market Wizards on psychology from interviews with pro traders\u000a+ Thomas Bulkowski: Encyclopedia of chart patterns \u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a**5.** Deepen your knowledge on specific trading sites such as forexop. com/gettingstarted/ \u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a## Resources and tools\u000aLet\u2019s have a further look at some of the most useful tools available to you.\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a**1.** Coinigy. com is a great tool to monitor cryptocurrencies. It uses the charting functionalities of TradingView and its API while providing a couple of other helpful functions such as order book preview etc. You can also use it for price alerts. If you don\u2019t want to purchase the premium version, simply renew the 30 day trial. I don\u2019t use its API access for trading but many do.\u000a\u000a**2.** tensorcharts. com is a must use tool. It\u2019s slightly complicated to set it up and to read the charts properly, but once you do understand its functionality, it\u2019s pretty valuable. Basically, it helps you to find support and resistance levels based on buy and sell orders. TC allows you to quickly identify areas in which there are significantly less buy/sell orders, which means that the price is more likely to cut through these ranges without much resistance. Many analysts rely on horizontal/vertical resistance lines but they often overlook orderbook data.\u000a\u000a**3.** qft.hodloo. com is excellent for identifying support areas. You can use it in combination with a trading method called QFL, which will be further explained in the following.\u000a\u000a**4.** Bitgur and its various pages are exceptionally useful in my opinion. I mostly use bitgur. com/map, bitgur. com/chart/interest & bitgur. com/ig/btc-market-overview. The heat maps are excellent for quickly spotting unusual movements that you can base swing trades on. The other pages are pretty helpful for gaining an overview of the market. Be sure to regularly check bitgur. com/chart/interest \u2013 it shows you futures sentiment by trader category (professional investors versus retail investors). Be skeptical when the difference between fund/retail sentiment is significant.\u000a\u000a**5.** Crypto twitter user \u201cZyzz\u201d has build a helpful tool for detecting volume changes in the markets, a link to it can be found on his twitter profile twitter. com/CryptoZyzz. A couple of paid signal providers appear to be using this or something similar. In general, this tool helps you to spot coins with significant volume changes, which indicate sudden price movements.\u000a\u000a**6.** rsihunter. com is excellent for everyone that uses RSI for technical analysis. The website helps you to identify the most attractive trading opportunities based on RSI. In short, this means you can identify oversold/overbought coins that have a high potential for a local trend reversal.\u000a\u000a**7.** Cindicator is marvelous for gaining the most representative statistics on market sentiment available as of now. Whether or not it should be used for trading decisions is open to debate. I purely use it for market sentiment analysis. Also, don\u2019t forget that basically anyone can participate in the surveys \u2013 it is not limited to experienced analysts. Still, it is astonishingly accurate and is therefore something to at least factor in with a range of other facts.\u000a\u000a**8.** athcoinindex. com and/or livecoinwatch. com for comparing a coin\u2019s present value to the ATH or ATL (all-time high/all-time low).\u000a\u000a**9.** coingossip.io & chantiment. com: Both of them are wonderful tools to identify which coins are talked about the most on Reddit/4chan/Twitter. 4chan loves Chainlink, Reddit likes Nano. Be mindful about these biases. Also, use these tools to catch sentiment changes.\u000a\u000a**10.** Fear and greed indices: alternative. me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/ is useful for getting a glimpse of the current market sentiment. Both extreme fear and greed can signal buying or selling opportunities respectively.\u000a\u000a**11.** Bitmex position calculators: if you\u2019re trading on margin, using one of the freely available anti-liquidation tools as well as position size calculators may be a good idea.\u000a\u000a**12.** Bitcoin NVT Signal: quite possibly one of the most effective indicators you could have used up until December 2017. A couple of us are testing a new hypothesis regarding this indicator (as it\u2019s reacting unusually) but it\u2019s too early to speculate openly about it. Keep watching it but be skeptical about it for the time being.\u000a\u000a**13.** cryptomiso. com: check the Github commit history of projects that you think are interesting. You can gain some great insights. Keep in mind that some projects may be developing their code in secret.\u000a\u000a**14.** onchainfx. com is excellent for having the most important statistics and figures in one place. You can sort projects based on customized columns, which can lead to pretty interesting insights.\u000a\u000a**15.** Spreadsheets: there are a number of helpful spreadsheets that you can make use of for all kinds of different purposes. A collection of free and basic spreadsheets can be found here: forexop. com/excel-downloads-strategies/. Those are neat as well: Portfolio tracker  np.reddit. com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7m3nvy/ive_created_an_excel_crypto_portfolio_tracker/  & Financial Modeling for Cryptocurrencies np.reddit. com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7kgk29/financial_modeling_for_cryptocurrencies_the/ . \u000a\u000a**16.** Portfolio tracker: coin. fyi (free). \u000a\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a##ICOs and fundamental analysis\u000aBoth subjects are related so I\u2018ll cover them for the sake of brevity in one subitem. Most investors are staying out of ICOs for the time being because the market simply is not attractive enough. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have a couple of strategies at your disposal you can apply to changing market circumstances.\u000aOnce ICOs gain more traction again, use icoalert. com, icobench. com, icodrops. com and concourseq.io to identify attractive and hyped projects.\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a**1.** Token economics: Your success with ICO\u2019s largely depends on the deal you get. From an investor\u2019s perspective, there\u2019s no point in investing into a promising project if the token economics are not favorable for you. Many retail investors overlook this important data set. I use a modified spreadsheet similar to the one Ian Balina is using. (Personally, I\u2019m not following him for various reasons). If there\u2019s interest, I can make this spreadsheet available. Have a look at the circulating supply and the total supply. If the percentage that is for sale is far below 50%, it is one red flag. Projects have gradually decreased this number over time ofc. Have a look at the market cap and calculate the market evaluation (= total supply x price per coin). Compare the cap & evaluation with related projects. If the market cap or evaluation is significantly above the ICO stats of competitors, you have another red flag. Similarly, have a look at the largest bonus. If the percentage is higher than 20%, you can expect some considerable dumps during exchange listings, depending on the project. \u000a\u000a**2.** Social metrics: having a great community behind a project is essential. However, be aware that many projects are heavily faking their social metrics. Take some time to gain an understanding on whether or not the numbers are faked. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that I discover a team buying telegram/twitter followers before starting their promotions. Luckily, this can be easily identified. Not many seem to do this kind of investigation.\u000a\u000a**3.** Find a couple of analysts that you trust: Influencers can make a lot of money by advertising projects. Try to filter these influencers and projects out. Your investment decision should not be largely dependent on influencers but on your own research. Use these analysts to identify promising projects and hyped coins. Personally, I find the analysis by Coin Crunch on YouTube to be unbiased and insightful \u2013 even though they haven\u2019t always been spot on. Try to find out which projects Suppoman & co. are shilling at the moment.\u000a\u000a**4.** Make use of ICO rating aggregators: These aggregators are excellent for gaining an overview of the different ratings from ICO analysts. In my opinion, aggregators are powerful tools as they help you to identify well-received projects. \u000a**5.** Real-world usage: Is the project solving a major problem? Is there a need for the project? Could the intended solution be also accomplished without using a blockchain? (Major red flag). Does the team have a strategy for monetizing their solution?\u000a\u000a**6.** Read the whitepaper: I cannot stress this enough. Ask yourself if the whitepaper is logical and sound. Is the team able to communicate its mission/vision or are they trying to hide behind elaborate and overly technical terms?\u000a\u000a**7.** Capable team members: Existing expertise in the industry? Successful track record of previous projects? Experience with building blockchains? Advisors with connections or other valuable assets? Team members with a sound marketing background? -> If too many of these questions can be answered with a \u201cno,\u201d it should raise some considerable red flags.\u000a\u000a**8.** Project type: make it a habit of identifying which type of project is currently performing significantly better than the rest. For instance, blockchain & cryptocurrency projects have been outperforming apps and services.\u000a\u000a**9.** Skepticism/critical thinking: try to develop a nuanced approach to evaluating the prospects of an ICO. Make it your goal to come up with as many reasons not to invest as possible. It will help you to avoid unpleasant surprises later on. Similarly, don\u2019t just read ICO reviews to reaffirm your present opinion (conformity bias). Instead, seek for analysts and reviewers that are critical in nature and have a knack of identifying a project\u2019s drawbacks.\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a##Flexibly use different effective trading/investing strategies (for instance QFL)\u000aDiscussing every possible trading strategy out there would go beyond the scope of this guide. The short version is this: flexibly adapt your strategies depending on the underlying market circumstances. Always be on the lookout for new strategies you can integrate into your arsenal to round off your investing/trading approach.\u000a\u000aOne strategy that has proven itself to be an excellent tool during panic sells is the so-called QFL trading methodology. It is a fantastic way for both beginners and experienced traders to profit from panic sells in the market. The strategy is more complex of course but can be summarized by the following: Invest a specified percentage of your allocated budget at key price levels around 10% below a base during a significant panic sell in the market. If it goes lower, allocate more of your budget. Set sell orders for the short-term recovery.\u000a\u000aReally, it needs more explaining than that so check out Quick Fingers Luc videos on YouTube and/or his discord community which is linked in his YouTube channel if you\u2019re interested in the strategy.\u000a\u000aPersonally, I\u2019m using some scanners to identify attractive price drops and to quickly respond to the market\u2019s behavior.\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a##Miscellaneous\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a**1.** Understand BTC seasonality: Assets tend to follow seasonal patterns. BTC is no exception from this. Taken on its own, market seasonality is useful but if you combine it with the other hard facts at your disposal, it can be pretty helpful. When looking at BTC price action during the last eight years or so, you can clearly see that June-October is the least attractive time period because of its downward action. Something you may wish to keep in mind.\u000a\u000a**2.** Predefined trading routines/rules: It\u2019s highly recommendable to have a set of investing/trading rules that you strictly adhere to. Personally, I\u2019ve got a checklist (ranging from technical indicators to market sentiment and a project\u2019s fundamentals) that I go through before I consider entering a long-term position. Similarly, I use a quick trading cheat sheet before entering a short-term position. Doing so will help you to leave emotions out of the equation and standardizes your investing/trading based on proven and effective metrics.\u000a\u000a**3.** Be willing to adapt your bias/opinion: Trading and investing is not about sticking to your opinion indefinitely once you\u2019ve made up your mind. Investors/traders that are permanently bearish/bullish will lose money in the long term. Forgive yourself for being wrong but make sure to never stay wrong for too long. Skilled traders are extremely flexible and adjust quickly if necessary.\u000a\u000a**4.** Understand the difference between following/coping others and gathering information: The reason why I\u2019m skimming through Twitter and why I read analysts\u2019 opinion on the market is not necessarily because I intend to follow them to a T. Instead, I use the information to prevent conformity bias and to make myself aware of things I would otherwise have overlooked.\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a##Closing remarks\u000aUse the information you have available to understand the current market sentiment (bearish/bullish). Don\u2019t place too much emphasis on other people\u2019s opinions but focus more on developing your own skills. Whether or not to invest should always be based upon your own analysis. Don\u2019t stare for too long at price charts and focus on the longer time frames. Never forget that most investors/traders are more successful with swing or long-term trades rather than day trades.\u000aI\u2019ve given you a couple of pretty effective tools that you can utilize to your advantage. However, what is really important is to actually apply what you have learned and to continuously keep improving your skillset.\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you have questions, feel free to ask in the comments or via PM. I\u2019m usually visiting Reddit every other day or so \u2013 it may take a couple of hours/days until I respond to PMs. **If you urgently want to get in touch with me, feel free to reach out through my discord community: discord app. com/ invite/ YfChuew   (my name is Spectator over there).** This Discord server is where I have built my free crypto dashboard that utilizes a wide variety of crypto bots and gives me quick access to important signals and information streams.

V<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>What\u2019s up Reddit? I thought my &quot;little&quot; crypto guide could be of use to some of you. Feel free to reach out if you have questions.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<blockquote>\u000a<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> <em>Use this guide to gain an edge over the market. Focus on the essentials and apply the tools described in the following intelligently. Don\u2019t make investing into cryptocurrencies and trading in general too complicated. Apply the KISS method, eliminate what doesn\u2019t work and focus on continuously increasing your efficiency/ROI. Use boring market phases to further develop your skill set and plan entries in undervalued projects. Gain access to the best information sources possible (see below) and develop a good understanding of the current market sentiment. Adapt flexibly to changing market circumstances, ideally by having a variety of investing/trading strategies at your disposal. Develop a feeling for what works under present market circumstances and leave out all the rest until the market changes.</em></p>\u000a</blockquote>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The following guide condenses everything I found helpful in gaining an edge over the market. It is, however, by no means intended to be exhaustive; there\u2019s always something new to be learned. Similarly, this guide heavily draws on everything I\u2019ve learned from my mentors. As I was standing on the shoulders of giants, I do not claim to be the original inventor/discoverer of all of this. It also draws heavily from Dr. Steve Brule\u2019s brilliant ideas whom I was privileged enough to get to know. Thank you for everything \u2013 you know who you are.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<hr/>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<h1>My Comprehensive Crypto Guide \u2013 Beating the Market 101</h1>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>To do well in crypto you should first and foremost understand the \u201cbasics.\u201d Once you have covered these, you can gradually advance your level of proficiency. The first part of this guide covers the rough essentials, skip this if you are already pretty experienced. The second part will go into more detail on the advanced strategies.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<hr/>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<h2>General rules for crypto investing and trading (the obvious \u201cbasics\u201d)</h2>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>A. Don\u2019t get overly complicated:</strong> Focus on swing trades or long-term holds instead of forcefully trying to day trade. A large percentage that gets into day trading will lose money because of it. Similarly, apply the 80/20 rule (Pareto principle) to discover what works best for you / is most profitable and eliminate all the rest.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>B. Before entering the markets, always check BTC first:</strong> The entire crypto market is heavily dependent on the price movement of BTC. Knowing how it is moving is essential for understanding how alts behave.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>C. Don\u2019t try to predict the market, react to it:</strong> A quick look into the trading ideas section of Trading View will show you that even the TA experts have a tough time in trying to predict market movements. Instead of trying to forecast movements, focus on trading and investing strategies that flexibly react to the market.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>D. Do not FOMO into all-time highs:</strong> If you come across an exciting project that is being hyped right now and has already pumped significantly, close your chart and wait for the correction. Set yourself an alert (for instance by using Coinigy. com) for a more reasonable price level and act accordingly once the alert is triggered.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>E. Cut your losses early but don\u2019t sell at all-time lows:</strong> Ideally you are cutting your losses early on at around 5-10%, depending on your trading/investment strategy. Doing so will help you to prevent selling at local lows. If you didn\u2019t follow this essential rule and are down considerably, consider taking the hit and further holding it \u2013 if you profoundly believe in the projects fundamentals. You might have to ignore such a bag for a couple of months or even years but you won\u2019t be one of those who sold BTC at $50 because of a 45% correction. Similarly, it takes nerves of steel not to sell into a dump. Develop the necessary patients to enter and exit during the most profitable moments.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>F. Take profits:</strong> Take profits early on to increase your profitability and make it a habit to take your principal investment out as soon as you have reached your targets. From this point on, you can either decide to let your \u201cfree\u201d coins ride or you can invest at a later stage once the correction is over. There always is a correction. Make sure not to get too greedy. It\u2019s better to sell at a 5-30% profit rather than hoping for unrealistic gains. </p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>G. Not entering a trade is the best decision in ~70% of all cases</strong> Try to eliminate investment/trading decisions that are based on emotions. Leave out emotions in general. Have the patience to wait for good entry points. Let the market come to you. Don\u2019t trade because you\u2019re bored. Less is definitely more when it comes to trading. Higher trading activity does not necessarily equal more profits.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>H. Know your risk:</strong> If you are entering a trade without having defined your risk-to-reward ratio, you will lose money in the long haul. If you know the amount of money you are willing to risk in advance, there will be no emotional decisions and no surprises.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>I. Avoid staring at charts all day:</strong> This is perhaps the most common source for bad trades. Relentlessly staring at your charts will lead you to become impatient, which in turn makes you come up with all kinds of \u201csignals\u201d that justify entering a bad position.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>J. Learn the basics of technical analysis (TA):</strong> There is no excuse for not knowing at least the fundamentals of TA. Even if you intend to enter long-term positions, it will greatly increase your ROI. It is a useful tool in your arsenal, use it. \u201cExperts\u201d telling you that TA does not work do so under the presumption that TA most work 100% of all the time, which it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s an exceptionally helpful tool \u2013 among other valuable instruments. More on TA later.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>K. Margin trading is a quick way to lose your money:</strong> Don\u2019t let stagnating market activity lure you into margin trading. If you have reasonable success with your investing/trading strategy, start with a maximum of 2-5x leverage. Anyone telling you to go beyond 10x is either a trading genius or out of his mind. In general, high leverage margin trading is gambling and nothing else, especially on manipulated exchanges.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>L. Use limit orders:</strong> Don\u2019t waste money on trading fees and potential profits by market buying. Set limit orders at attractive price levels and have the patience to wait long enough until your order is filled.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>M. Understand the nature of stop/loss orders:</strong> Crypto is a heavily manipulated market. Manipulators will try to trigger your S/L orders. For this reason, use them sparingly and only when you are unable to follow the market.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>N. Never marry a project:</strong> There appears to be a pretty intensive rivalry between numerous crypto projects. I\u2019m not a fan boy so I don\u2019t really care whether VET is better than WTC or not \u2013 I profited from both of them. Ask yourself if you want to be an investor or a fan. There\u2019s no problem with being both as long as it does not cloud your judgment.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>O. Psychology:</strong> Understand your own and the market participant\u2019s psychology. Keep emotions out of the equation. Don\u2019t panic during a panic sell \u2013 that\u2019s what everyone else does. Instead, apply the most effective strategies or countermeasures during these unexpected market events, for example QFL-style trading (which will be covered later on). Cut your losses once the recovery happens later on. If you closely look at the charts, you will see that dumps of solid projects are usually followed by short-term recoveries that help you to exit with less losses.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>P. Market manipulation:</strong> Due to lacking oversight and regulations, crypto markets are the most manipulated markets you can possibly invest in. The majority of price action results from whales or their bots playing with you or with each other. It\u2019s not unusual to encounter manipulators that try to get you to FOMO or panic sell so that they can either dump upon you or buy at cheaper levels. To succeed in this game, most investors are best off when buying pre-FOMO while the market is still low. The shorter the time frame of your holding period, the more affected you will be by price manipulation.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>Q. Buy low sell high:</strong> Find attractive entries when the charts show sideways price action or flat price floors. The most dangerous time to invest is during a pump or FOMO rally. Have the patience to miss out on coins that have already gone parabolic if you want to avoid becoming a bag holder.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>R. Sell in May and go away (sort of):</strong> The period from October to December is seasonally exceptionally strong \u2013 not just in the stock markets (since 1896 strength pattern Oct-Dec observable) but also when it comes to BTC. Similarly, June to September isn\u2019t that attractive. Be sure to keep these historical patterns in mind \u2013 especially when you decide to trade against them. The probability to lose money while trading against the pattern is higher than to make money. At the same time, in stocks you have more market bottoms occurring in October than in other months. In short, this does not mean you need to exit all markets during specific time periods but it could be helpful to know which pattern has a higher probability of playing out.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>S. Beware of traps:</strong> Market manipulators may use an accumulation of bullish setups or too much attention on a key breakout area to shake out / trap a large portion of traders. Keep this in mind when you see setups that are too good to be true.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>T. Accept that the market is smarter than you:</strong> Adapt to the fact that the market is smarter and more resourceful than you are. There\u2019s no point in trying to force your will on the market. Similarly, the market is able to forecast important events astonishingly well ahead of time. When the news breaks, it is more than likely that the information is already priced in.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<hr/>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<h2>Technical analysis</h2>\u000a\u000a<p>TA is predictive not definitive. Most people make the mistake of assuming that TA is 100% accurate (it is not). Once they figure that out, they quickly become disappointed and stop using it altogether. Don\u2019t be like the masses. Incorporate TA intelligently into your comprehensive crypto arsenal. Ignore it at your own risk but don\u2019t become overly dependent on it.  It is an effective tool if applied correctly. Use TA to identify up/downtrends, support and resistance lines as well as the most common and most effective price patterns. Use this information to identify lucrative entry and exit points. \u000aYou don\u2019t need to be a TA crack to succeed. The beauty with cryptos is that you can be pretty successful with a basic understanding of TA and a selection of the most powerful indicators/oscillators at your hand. </p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>Focus on identifying support/resistance lines as well as order blocks and make use of volume, trendlines, RSI, sRSI, MFI, Fibonacci extensions/retracements &amp; Bollinger bands. Developing a reasonable understanding of these TA tools will cover you in 99% of all cases.</strong> You can include MACD and Ichimoku clouds. Elliott waves aren\u2019t that reliable in my opinion.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>1.</strong> Every chart tells a story. Learn to read it. Have a look at the volume. Is the volume justifying the current price movement? In general, a pump without volume will most likely not be supported for too long (i.e. prices will dump shortly after). Similarly, a tiny candlestick in combination with a huge spike in volume is a telltale sign of a reversal. Another interesting sign is rapidly increasing volume while prices remain stagnant over some period of time.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>2.</strong> Focus on the most effective indicators and the most effective trading patterns. Don\u2019t just blindly rely on indicators that the next random guy on Twitter recommends. Be scientific about your approach. Use only those particular indicators that work the best. Indicator back testing with market data from almost 15 years by Emerald Summit highlights a couple of excellent and highly successful indicators/oscillators: </p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>RSI (Relative Strength Index): most successful indicator of the study</li>\u000a<li>RMI (Relative Momentum Index): generates profits with long positions. Not for the short term</li>\u000a<li>MFI (Money Flow Index): indicator is beating the benchmark with long positions</li>\u000a<li>sRSI/Stochastics: outperforms the benchmark but not always profitable</li>\u000a<li>BB (Bollinger Bands): outperforms benchmark for five-day swing trading</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p><em>Ineffective indicators are:</em></p>\u000a\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>SMA (Simple Moving Average): results are worse than random trading =&gt; useless</li>\u000a<li>EMA (Exponential Moving Average): generates substantial losses</li>\u000a<li>CCI (Commodity Channel Index): generates losses</li>\u000a<li>MACD (Moving Average Convergence-Divergence): low levels of successfulness</li>\u000a<li>TRIXS: generates losses</li>\u000a<li>Parabolic SAR: poor results</li>\u000a</ul>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>CMO wasn\u2019t tested but I like it as well. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily exclude SMAs/EMAs because of these results \u2013 they are still valid for identifying support and resistance levels.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>3.</strong> Compare a chart\u2019s different time frames. Start with the daily timeframe and work yourself towards the shorter time frames. In general, it\u2019s not a good idea to enter positions without checking multiple time frames first. The daily chart gives you an excellent overview. 1h-4h time frames are excellent for entering swing positions. 5m-15m should only be used for discovering the optimal entry/exit points, if it all. Anything below 1h is not going to be of much help to the majority of traders/investors. In case you\u2019re <strong>tired of clicking through all the time frames on Trading View</strong>: <em>I am using crafty bots on Discord to help me check the various time frames at a glance. Invite link to access my Discord crypto dashboard so that you can use these bots for free can be found at the bottom of this guide.</em></p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>4.</strong> Develop your TA skills by actively drawing charts and/or monitoring indicators. Share your strategies with like-minded and experienced individuals and listen to their feedback. Do some back testing to improve your accuracy and to identify mistakes.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>5.</strong> Learn from the pros by reading or watching their TA analysis. More on this later on.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<hr/>\u000a\u000a<h2>Market information and signals</h2>\u000a\u000a<p>Information is key. Gain access to a stream of quickly accessible and high-quality crypto information sources or signals. Differentiate between information for the masses (mainstream media etc.) and information for the classes to filter out the former. Professionals in this area do not rely on news narratives for their decision-making. Instead, they look at the hard facts, price action, a project\u2019s fundamentals etc. Use the information streams you have available to develop a feeling for the current market sentiment. At the beginning, I was switching from Reddit to Twitter to YouTube to Telegram to Medium in combination with email/SMS alerts and a couple of other services, which is quite tiresome.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Later on, I\u2019ve built my personal crypto dashboard on Discord where I have everything in one place \u2013 from all the Twitter influencers and YouTubers to the most helpful indicators, bots and signals. I\u2019ve created specific Discord channels for each influencer/signal provider. New posts are highlighted, so I no longer have to check all the different platforms. I rarely leave Reddit/Discord these days. Saves me a lot of time and helps me to focus on what is really important: making investment and trading decisions. </p>\u000a\u000a<p>Originally, I was using the dashboard that I\u2019ve built only by myself but a couple of my trading friends convinced me of opening it up to them and others. You can <strong>build your own Discord crypto dashboard if you\u2019re technically skilled or join our community</strong>, invite link can be found at the end of this guide. Discord has become a crucial aspect of my crypto journey so I would recommend anyone to look into it and to possibly build such a dashboard for yourself if you are inclined to do so and have the necessary time for it.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>1.</strong> Twitter influencers: In general, Crypto Twitter is highly irrational, short-term oriented and either obsessively bullish or pessimistically bearish. Be prepared to get manipulated. I skim through the tweets of a couple Twitter personalities (~ 5 mins) to quickly gain a feeling for the market sentiment. Amongst them are Edward Morra, zyzz, ThinkingUSD, Gordon Crypto, Crypto Rand, Crypto Cred, Eric Choe, Cryptodonald, Peter Brandt, Trace Mayer and Coffee. Twitter is excellent for gaining a microscopic (!) perspective on the present market conditions. We\u2019ll use other tools for the macro perspective. Filter drama and unnecessary discussions/comments as much as possible. Create a Twitter list with your most favorite influencers or use Discord to integrate them all in one place like I do, which has the advantage that you can filter out replies/comments and retweets.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>2.</strong> YouTubers: YT is excellent to familiarize yourself with the different approaches and methodologies of experienced investors/traders. Next to Twitter, YouTube adds a broader and more nuanced perspective to your market information arsenal. The analysis you can find on YT is more detailed and less opinionated. I like Alessio Rastani, Josh Olszewicz, Tradedevil and The Chart Guys. Quickfingers Luc is excellent for QFL-style trading. \u201cIn it for the Money\u201c is a great microcap picker during bull markets. Philakone has useful tutorials for daytrading and swing trading but I don\u2018t trust him. Crypto Cred has great tutorials as well. Watch videos at 1.5x speed or faster. Know that certain influential YouTubers have been caught in market manipulating activities. Use YouTube subscription alerts to get a notification when a new video has been released. Discord is also excellent for following these YouTube influencers without clustering your YouTube feed.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>3.</strong> Telegram: Some excellent analysts can be found on Telegram. This medium allows you to add a more detailed perspective on the markets to your portfolio \u2013 generally with a longer timeframe in mind. I found the market analysis by Bitcoin Bravado and CC insider to be pretty useful. Alan Masters has an interesting channel as well. There are some more like CryptoSamurai1, cryptocue, cryptobullet and coinguru1113 but the former two should have you covered in the beginning. You can pin around five Telegram channels in the app. If that isn\u2019t enough for you (it isn\u2019t for me), I highly recommend using Discord even though this one is a bit more difficult to set up. Let me know if you need help.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>4.</strong> Long/Short: The Long-Short ratio gives you a good feeling of the market sentiment. If the majority of traders are long, it indicates bullish tendencies in the market. Similarly, sudden changes in the ratio indicate changing sentiments. In general, when short interest hits local highs (or even record highs), it\u2019s an indication that we are close to the bottom. You can use Trading View to compare the charts. I found it easier and faster to simply use the margin-bots that I have available in Discord, they show me percentage changes in the Long-Short ratio so I can directly compare both instead of skipping from one chart to the other.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>5.</strong> Mainstream media: CNBC\u2019s Fast Money is an excellent counter indicator. If you don\u2019t believe me, compare price action after bearish/bullish tweets. You\u2019ll be surprised at the accuracy of this counter indicator. As a general rule of thumb, mainstream news sources are intended for the masses not for the classes. Both extremes of public opinion (excessively bearish or bullish) are contrarian signals for us. Extreme pessimism can (!) be a bullish sign and extreme optimism can (!) be a warning sign. It is one signal that we need to factor in with other hard facts.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>6.</strong> Cryptocurrency calendars: coinmarketcal. com and cryptocalendar.pro are useful to check upcoming events of a variety of different projects. I have them all in one channel and skim through it regularly. Usually, the market behaves according to the principle \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the news\u201d meaning that many investors will take profit once the news has broken. Be prepared to get dumped upon at the announcement of the news, for instance a mainnet launch whose date was publicized long before. The following correction is a great opportunity to buy the dip btw.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>7.</strong> News aggregators: cryptopanic. com is excellent for skimming the most important headlines. It may be a good idea to aggregate a couple of sources to prevent bias.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>8.</strong> Tether print alerts: Newly printed Tether and the movement of large sums of it indicate or at least hint at significant market activity in the short term.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>9.</strong> TradingView trading ideas: I\u2019ve created my own channels for the top 10 cryptocurrency analysts on TradingView. It should also be possible to receive their latest trading ideas by following them on TradingView but that\u2019s not my preferred way of doing it. I found it helpful to read through their trading ideas and to read their opinions. Try to profile each trader and categorize their ideas/recommendations accordingly. Some are great at market analysis while others have interesting short-term trading ideas.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>10.</strong> Reddit/4chan/Medium: Not much needs to be said about this point. Filter out the garbage and use the occasional pieces of gold to your advantage. I\u2019ve got feeds for each of the three. To put it bluntly, I don\u2019t care about a rivalry between the individual platforms and who thinks is smarter or who has the better users. There will always be personal preferences not only on the three mentioned above but also on YouTube, Twitter, telegram, twitch etc. Every source has its advantages and shortcomings.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<hr/>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<h2>Learning materials</h2>\u000a\u000a<p>There\u2019s always something new you can learn. Use boring market periods to hone your skills.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>1.</strong> Take the free trading course at babypips. com/learn/forex. It is centered on forex but also applies to crypto as well. If you\u2019re short on time, follow the program at least to the \u201cundergraduate freshman\u201d level.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>2.</strong> DataDash has created some excellent instruction videos for learning the basics of TA and fundamental analysis. Go through his videos at 1.5x speed. Beginner level: youtube. com/watch?v=RQtvpNYtLfw, Intermediate: youtube. com/watch?v=pYWdrn3JD40 and Advanced: youtube. com/watch?v=zBjbyew6oyc</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>3.</strong> CryptoCred\u2019s technical analysis lessons are pretty helpful as well: Google document with his lessons: docs.google. com/document/d/15c3rN15rkXldY8Te3GDG4NG7noaaoikydOoZQlElwXw/preview</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>4.</strong> Books help you to increase your understanding of market dynamics. Essential reading materials are:</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<ul>\u000a<li>Mark Douglas: Trading in the Zone &amp; The Disciplined Trader (psychological preparation)</li>\u000a<li>Jack D. Schwager: Market Wizards on psychology from interviews with pro traders</li>\u000a<li>Thomas Bulkowski: Encyclopedia of chart patterns </li>\u000a</ul>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>5.</strong> Deepen your knowledge on specific trading sites such as forexop. com/gettingstarted/ </p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<hr/>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<h2>Resources and tools</h2>\u000a\u000a<p>Let\u2019s have a further look at some of the most useful tools available to you.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>1.</strong> Coinigy. com is a great tool to monitor cryptocurrencies. It uses the charting functionalities of TradingView and its API while providing a couple of other helpful functions such as order book preview etc. You can also use it for price alerts. If you don\u2019t want to purchase the premium version, simply renew the 30 day trial. I don\u2019t use its API access for trading but many do.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>2.</strong> tensorcharts. com is a must use tool. It\u2019s slightly complicated to set it up and to read the charts properly, but once you do understand its functionality, it\u2019s pretty valuable. Basically, it helps you to find support and resistance levels based on buy and sell orders. TC allows you to quickly identify areas in which there are significantly less buy/sell orders, which means that the price is more likely to cut through these ranges without much resistance. Many analysts rely on horizontal/vertical resistance lines but they often overlook orderbook data.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>3.</strong> qft.hodloo. com is excellent for identifying support areas. You can use it in combination with a trading method called QFL, which will be further explained in the following.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>4.</strong> Bitgur and its various pages are exceptionally useful in my opinion. I mostly use bitgur. com/map, bitgur. com/chart/interest &amp; bitgur. com/ig/btc-market-overview. The heat maps are excellent for quickly spotting unusual movements that you can base swing trades on. The other pages are pretty helpful for gaining an overview of the market. Be sure to regularly check bitgur. com/chart/interest \u2013 it shows you futures sentiment by trader category (professional investors versus retail investors). Be skeptical when the difference between fund/retail sentiment is significant.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>5.</strong> Crypto twitter user \u201cZyzz\u201d has build a helpful tool for detecting volume changes in the markets, a link to it can be found on his twitter profile twitter. com/CryptoZyzz. A couple of paid signal providers appear to be using this or something similar. In general, this tool helps you to spot coins with significant volume changes, which indicate sudden price movements.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>6.</strong> rsihunter. com is excellent for everyone that uses RSI for technical analysis. The website helps you to identify the most attractive trading opportunities based on RSI. In short, this means you can identify oversold/overbought coins that have a high potential for a local trend reversal.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>7.</strong> Cindicator is marvelous for gaining the most representative statistics on market sentiment available as of now. Whether or not it should be used for trading decisions is open to debate. I purely use it for market sentiment analysis. Also, don\u2019t forget that basically anyone can participate in the surveys \u2013 it is not limited to experienced analysts. Still, it is astonishingly accurate and is therefore something to at least factor in with a range of other facts.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>8.</strong> athcoinindex. com and/or livecoinwatch. com for comparing a coin\u2019s present value to the ATH or ATL (all-time high/all-time low).</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>9.</strong> coingossip.io &amp; chantiment. com: Both of them are wonderful tools to identify which coins are talked about the most on Reddit/4chan/Twitter. 4chan loves Chainlink, Reddit likes Nano. Be mindful about these biases. Also, use these tools to catch sentiment changes.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>10.</strong> Fear and greed indices: alternative. me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/ is useful for getting a glimpse of the current market sentiment. Both extreme fear and greed can signal buying or selling opportunities respectively.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>11.</strong> Bitmex position calculators: if you\u2019re trading on margin, using one of the freely available anti-liquidation tools as well as position size calculators may be a good idea.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>12.</strong> Bitcoin NVT Signal: quite possibly one of the most effective indicators you could have used up until December 2017. A couple of us are testing a new hypothesis regarding this indicator (as it\u2019s reacting unusually) but it\u2019s too early to speculate openly about it. Keep watching it but be skeptical about it for the time being.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>13.</strong> cryptomiso. com: check the Github commit history of projects that you think are interesting. You can gain some great insights. Keep in mind that some projects may be developing their code in secret.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>14.</strong> onchainfx. com is excellent for having the most important statistics and figures in one place. You can sort projects based on customized columns, which can lead to pretty interesting insights.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>15.</strong> Spreadsheets: there are a number of helpful spreadsheets that you can make use of for all kinds of different purposes. A collection of free and basic spreadsheets can be found here: forexop. com/excel-downloads-strategies/. Those are neat as well: Portfolio tracker  np.reddit. com<a href="/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7m3nvy/ive_created_an_excel_crypto_portfolio_tracker/">/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7m3nvy/ive_created_an_excel_crypto_portfolio_tracker/</a>  &amp; Financial Modeling for Cryptocurrencies np.reddit. com<a href="/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7kgk29/financial_modeling_for_cryptocurrencies_the/">/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7kgk29/financial_modeling_for_cryptocurrencies_the/</a> . </p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>16.</strong> Portfolio tracker: coin. fyi (free). </p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<hr/>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<h2>ICOs and fundamental analysis</h2>\u000a\u000a<p>Both subjects are related so I\u2018ll cover them for the sake of brevity in one subitem. Most investors are staying out of ICOs for the time being because the market simply is not attractive enough. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have a couple of strategies at your disposal you can apply to changing market circumstances.\u000aOnce ICOs gain more traction again, use icoalert. com, icobench. com, icodrops. com and concourseq.io to identify attractive and hyped projects.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>1.</strong> Token economics: Your success with ICO\u2019s largely depends on the deal you get. From an investor\u2019s perspective, there\u2019s no point in investing into a promising project if the token economics are not favorable for you. Many retail investors overlook this important data set. I use a modified spreadsheet similar to the one Ian Balina is using. (Personally, I\u2019m not following him for various reasons). If there\u2019s interest, I can make this spreadsheet available. Have a look at the circulating supply and the total supply. If the percentage that is for sale is far below 50%, it is one red flag. Projects have gradually decreased this number over time ofc. Have a look at the market cap and calculate the market evaluation (= total supply x price per coin). Compare the cap &amp; evaluation with related projects. If the market cap or evaluation is significantly above the ICO stats of competitors, you have another red flag. Similarly, have a look at the largest bonus. If the percentage is higher than 20%, you can expect some considerable dumps during exchange listings, depending on the project. </p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>2.</strong> Social metrics: having a great community behind a project is essential. However, be aware that many projects are heavily faking their social metrics. Take some time to gain an understanding on whether or not the numbers are faked. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that I discover a team buying telegram/twitter followers before starting their promotions. Luckily, this can be easily identified. Not many seem to do this kind of investigation.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>3.</strong> Find a couple of analysts that you trust: Influencers can make a lot of money by advertising projects. Try to filter these influencers and projects out. Your investment decision should not be largely dependent on influencers but on your own research. Use these analysts to identify promising projects and hyped coins. Personally, I find the analysis by Coin Crunch on YouTube to be unbiased and insightful \u2013 even though they haven\u2019t always been spot on. Try to find out which projects Suppoman &amp; co. are shilling at the moment.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>4.</strong> Make use of ICO rating aggregators: These aggregators are excellent for gaining an overview of the different ratings from ICO analysts. In my opinion, aggregators are powerful tools as they help you to identify well-received projects. \u000a<strong>5.</strong> Real-world usage: Is the project solving a major problem? Is there a need for the project? Could the intended solution be also accomplished without using a blockchain? (Major red flag). Does the team have a strategy for monetizing their solution?</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>6.</strong> Read the whitepaper: I cannot stress this enough. Ask yourself if the whitepaper is logical and sound. Is the team able to communicate its mission/vision or are they trying to hide behind elaborate and overly technical terms?</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>7.</strong> Capable team members: Existing expertise in the industry? Successful track record of previous projects? Experience with building blockchains? Advisors with connections or other valuable assets? Team members with a sound marketing background? -&gt; If too many of these questions can be answered with a \u201cno,\u201d it should raise some considerable red flags.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>8.</strong> Project type: make it a habit of identifying which type of project is currently performing significantly better than the rest. For instance, blockchain &amp; cryptocurrency projects have been outperforming apps and services.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>9.</strong> Skepticism/critical thinking: try to develop a nuanced approach to evaluating the prospects of an ICO. Make it your goal to come up with as many reasons not to invest as possible. It will help you to avoid unpleasant surprises later on. Similarly, don\u2019t just read ICO reviews to reaffirm your present opinion (conformity bias). Instead, seek for analysts and reviewers that are critical in nature and have a knack of identifying a project\u2019s drawbacks.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<hr/>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<h2>Flexibly use different effective trading/investing strategies (for instance QFL)</h2>\u000a\u000a<p>Discussing every possible trading strategy out there would go beyond the scope of this guide. The short version is this: flexibly adapt your strategies depending on the underlying market circumstances. Always be on the lookout for new strategies you can integrate into your arsenal to round off your investing/trading approach.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>One strategy that has proven itself to be an excellent tool during panic sells is the so-called QFL trading methodology. It is a fantastic way for both beginners and experienced traders to profit from panic sells in the market. The strategy is more complex of course but can be summarized by the following: Invest a specified percentage of your allocated budget at key price levels around 10% below a base during a significant panic sell in the market. If it goes lower, allocate more of your budget. Set sell orders for the short-term recovery.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Really, it needs more explaining than that so check out Quick Fingers Luc videos on YouTube and/or his discord community which is linked in his YouTube channel if you\u2019re interested in the strategy.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Personally, I\u2019m using some scanners to identify attractive price drops and to quickly respond to the market\u2019s behavior.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<hr/>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>1.</strong> Understand BTC seasonality: Assets tend to follow seasonal patterns. BTC is no exception from this. Taken on its own, market seasonality is useful but if you combine it with the other hard facts at your disposal, it can be pretty helpful. When looking at BTC price action during the last eight years or so, you can clearly see that June-October is the least attractive time period because of its downward action. Something you may wish to keep in mind.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>2.</strong> Predefined trading routines/rules: It\u2019s highly recommendable to have a set of investing/trading rules that you strictly adhere to. Personally, I\u2019ve got a checklist (ranging from technical indicators to market sentiment and a project\u2019s fundamentals) that I go through before I consider entering a long-term position. Similarly, I use a quick trading cheat sheet before entering a short-term position. Doing so will help you to leave emotions out of the equation and standardizes your investing/trading based on proven and effective metrics.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>3.</strong> Be willing to adapt your bias/opinion: Trading and investing is not about sticking to your opinion indefinitely once you\u2019ve made up your mind. Investors/traders that are permanently bearish/bullish will lose money in the long term. Forgive yourself for being wrong but make sure to never stay wrong for too long. Skilled traders are extremely flexible and adjust quickly if necessary.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>4.</strong> Understand the difference between following/coping others and gathering information: The reason why I\u2019m skimming through Twitter and why I read analysts\u2019 opinion on the market is not necessarily because I intend to follow them to a T. Instead, I use the information to prevent conformity bias and to make myself aware of things I would otherwise have overlooked.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<hr/>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<h2>Closing remarks</h2>\u000a\u000a<p>Use the information you have available to understand the current market sentiment (bearish/bullish). Don\u2019t place too much emphasis on other people\u2019s opinions but focus more on developing your own skills. Whether or not to invest should always be based upon your own analysis. Don\u2019t stare for too long at price charts and focus on the longer time frames. Never forget that most investors/traders are more successful with swing or long-term trades rather than day trades.\u000aI\u2019ve given you a couple of pretty effective tools that you can utilize to your advantage. However, what is really important is to actually apply what you have learned and to continuously keep improving your skillset.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<hr/>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>If you have questions, feel free to ask in the comments or via PM. I\u2019m usually visiting Reddit every other day or so \u2013 it may take a couple of hours/days until I respond to PMs. <strong>If you urgently want to get in touch with me, feel free to reach out through my discord community: discord app. com/ invite/ YfChuew   (my name is Spectator over there).</strong> This Discord server is where I have built my free crypto dashboard that utilizes a wide variety of crypto bots and gives me quick access to important signals and information streams.</p>\u000a</div><!-- SC_ON -->

V&nbsp;\u000a\u000a[**Take me directly to the official BITCOIN BET FOR THE VETS pledge page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8z9cx2/daily_discussion_july_16_2018/e2iiems/)\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000aHello! Some of you may know me from the Daily Discussion thread here. I am an enthusiastic supporter of Bitcoin and also the author of **Hopium Time** (formerly Daily Hopium). Hopium Time is my effort to improve morale of the Bitcoin community during the dark times of current bear market we've been enduring. In my posts I make an effort to post good news and show parallels to previous Bitcoin bear markets to provide perspective when things look bleak.\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000aI also like to make predictions. My core prediction is as follows:\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a **The price of ONE BITCOIN will surpass $100,000 USD before May 1, 2021.**\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000aTo illustrate my conviction on this prediction and to help my favorite charity, [The Independence Fund](http://www.independencefund.org/), I have made it into a [Bet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8z9cx2/daily_discussion_july_16_2018/e2iiems).  I\u2019m calling it my Bitcoin Bet for the Vets (BBV). Please take a look at [my post ](https://www.reddit.czm/r/Bitcoin/comments/8z9cx2/daily_discussion_july_16_2018/e2iiems) on this. I would really like this to grow into a nice donation to the charity which is very helpful to Veterans and their families. Hopefully some of you guys will pledge to match my Bet.\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000a**7/21/18 Revision to bet matching:**\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000aI will allow someone who pledges to match my bet to decide what percentage of my donation they will match (minimum of 5%).  Please reply directly to the bet thread to make your honor bound irrevocable commitment to donate with me on May 1, 2021.  I will include you on my public list of donors.  Also, while I have pledged to donate enough to buy one track chair for the Vets even if I win the bet, you as a bet matcher, will be encouraged to do the same, but it is not required.\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000aI will attempt to contact some of the leading Bitcoin bulls in the media (John McAfee, Tom Lee, Tim Draper etc.) and let you know in this thread if they plan to participate in my Bet or not. So you may want to check back on this thread from time to time for a status update.\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000aImagine the good we could do together if more people got involved.  We can show the world how generous the crypto community can be. Good for the Vets and good for bitcoin.  Everybody wins!\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000aFollow me on my new Twitter [@ThePhysicistBTC](http://twitter.com/ThePhysicistBTC)\u000a\u000a&nbsp;\u000a\u000aI will maintain an archive of all my **Hopium Time** posts here, in case you are feeling a little down and need a quick reality check or pick-me-up.

Some of you may know me from the Daily Discussion thread here. I am an enthusiastic supporter of Bitcoin and also the author of <strong>Hopium Time</strong> (formerly Daily Hopium). Hopium Time is my effort to improve morale of the Bitcoin community during the dark times of current bear market we&#39;ve been enduring. In my posts I make an effort to post good news and show parallels to previous Bitcoin bear markets to provide perspective when things look bleak.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>I also like to make predictions. My core prediction is as follows:</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p> <strong>The price of ONE BITCOIN will surpass $100,000 USD before May 1, 2021.</strong></p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>To illustrate my conviction on this prediction and to help my favorite charity, <a href="http://www.independencefund.org/">The Independence Fund</a>, I have made it into a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8z9cx2/daily_discussion_july_16_2018/e2iiems">Bet</a>.  I\u2019m calling it my Bitcoin Bet for the Vets (BBV). Please take a look at <a href="https://www.reddit.czm/r/Bitcoin/comments/8z9cx2/daily_discussion_july_16_2018/e2iiems">my post </a> on this. I would really like this to grow into a nice donation to the charity which is very helpful to Veterans and their families. Hopefully some of you guys will pledge to match my Bet.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>7/21/18 Revision to bet matching:</strong></p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>I will allow someone who pledges to match my bet to decide what percentage of my donation they will match (minimum of 5%).  Please reply directly to the bet thread to make your honor bound irrevocable commitment to donate with me on May 1, 2021.  I will include you on my public list of donors.  Also, while I have pledged to donate enough to buy one track chair for the Vets even if I win the bet, you as a bet matcher, will be encouraged to do the same, but it is not required.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>I will attempt to contact some of the leading Bitcoin bulls in the media (John McAfee, Tom Lee, Tim Draper etc.) and let you know in this thread if they plan to participate in my Bet or not. So you may want to check back on this thread from time to time for a status update.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Imagine the good we could do together if more people got involved.  We can show the world how generous the crypto community can be. Good for the Vets and good for bitcoin.  Everybody wins!</p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Follow me on my new Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/ThePhysicistBTC">@ThePhysicistBTC</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>&nbsp;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>I will maintain an archive of all my <strong>Hopium Time</strong> posts here, in case you are feeling a little down and need a quick reality check or pick-me-up.

VHut 8 Mining Corp. Announces First Quarter 2018 Financial Results\u000a\u000aAll Figures in Canadian Dollars Unless Otherwise Noted\u000a\u000aCompany raised $70.0 million to fund investment in mining hardware Entered into definitive agreement with the City of Medicine Hat for the supply of 42 MW of electric energy First quarter 2018 revenue of $10,988,949 Strong gross profit margin of 80%, or $8,823,650 (excluding depreciation) Adjusted EBITDA of $7,690,365 828 Bitcoin mined in Q1\u000a\u000aTORONTO, May 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hut 8 Mining Corp. (TSX-V:HUT) (\u201cHut 8\u201d, or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a cryptocurrency mining and blockchain infrastructure company established through an exclusive arrangement with the world\u2019s leading full-service blockchain technology company, the Bitfury Group, is pleased to announce its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 (\u201cQ1 2018\u201d). Hut 8 owns Bitcoin mining datacenters called BlockBoxes that are purchased from the Bitfury Group.\u000a\u000aCorporate Update\u000a\u000aAndrew Kiguel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hut 8, said: \u201cWe are pleased with the progress Hut 8 has made in a very short period of time. Hut 8 began mining on December 22, 2017 with 7 BlockBoxes in Drumheller, Alberta, with power capacity of 7.7 MW, representing 52.5 PH/s. On February 7, 2018, an additional 10 BlockBoxes were added in Drumheller for an aggregate power capacity of 18.7 MW, representing 128 PH/s. Despite the ramp-up period, in Q1 2018 Hut 8 was able to mine a total of 828 Bitcoin. As of May 24, 2018, Hut 8 has mined in excess of 1,300 Bitcoin which we continue to hold.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are excited that our data center build-out in the City of Medicine Hat is well underway. We estimate that full-scale production will commence by September 2018. The City of Medicine Hat site will consist of an additional 40 BlockBoxes. Once operational, Hut 8 will own 57 BlockBoxes, representing a 335% increase from current mining capacity, securing our position as one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners in the world, with a total of 66.7 MW of power capacity and 448 PH/s. With this increase in BlockBoxes from 17 to 57, we expect that our daily mining production will increase significantly. We believe our City of Medicine Hat Facility will represent operational excellence and set a new global benchmark for industrial scale cryptocurrency mining operations,\u201d added Kiguel.\u000a\u000aManufactured by the Bitfury Group, the BlockBoxes are regarded as one of the most powerful and cost-effective Bitcoin mining solutions available on the market. The BlockBoxes are based on cutting-edge hardware and software and are fully configurable and upgradeable to the next generation of silicon technology. The efficient design and low operating cost of the BlockBoxes makes Bitcoin mining more productive and affordable. As previously disclosed, Hut 8 has obtained an exclusive right to all Bitfury Group hardware and software solutions, including the BlockBoxes, for cryptocurrency mining within North America.\u000a\u000aQ1 2018 Financial Results\u000a\u000aQ1 2018 represented Hut 8\u2019s first full quarter in operations. With a gross profit margin of 80% (excluding depreciation), the Company\u2019s mining cost-per-bitcoin was $2,615 (US$2,028), which compares favorably to the selling price of Bitcoin at the end of Q1 2018, being $8,991.67 (US$6,973.53).\u000a\u000aThe Company believes that Hut 8 is amongst the lowest cost miners of Bitcoin in the world. Hut 8 anticipates its cost per Bitcoin to remain competitive, based on the increasing difficulty rate, offset by the City of Medicine Hat site that will operate more efficiently, next generation BlockBoxes, and a benefit from an improved energy contract for the price of electricity over the Drumheller site.\u000a\u000aSelected Financial Highlights from Q1 2018\u000a\u000aRevenues of $10,988,949 Gross profit of $8,823,650 (excluding depreciation) EBITDA1 of $1,824,685 and Adjusted EBITDA1 of $7,690,365 Completion of the Company\u2019s \u201cQualifying Transaction\u201d Raised $70.0 million of equity capital to fund investments and growth Cash balance of $23.7 million and working capital of $19.3 million Mined 828 Bitcoin in Q1 2018, bringing total mined since commencing operations on December 21, 2017 to over 1,300 On February 7, 2018, added 10 new operating BlockBox Data Centers for a total of 17 in operation, representing 18.7 MW / 128 PH/s Purchased 40 additional BlockBoxes to be operational by Q3 2018 representing additional 48 MW / 320 PH/s Entered into definitive agreements with the city of Medicine Hat for the supply of 42 MW of electric energy and the lease of land\u000a\u000aSummary of Q1 2018 Financial Results Revenue $ 10,988,949\u000aGross Profit $ 3,183,181\u000aGross Profit % 29%\u000aGross Profit (excluding depreciation) $ 8,823,650\u000aGross Profit % (excluding depreciation) 80%\u000aOperating income $ 218,701\u000aNet Loss $ (3,815,784 ) EBITDA $ 1,824,685\u000aAdjusted EBITDA* $ 7,690,365\u000aLoss per share $ (0.05 ) * EBITDA adjusted for fair value re-measurement of digital assets, listing expense and one time transactional costs.\u000a\u000aAs a result of the decrease in the price of Bitcoin in Q1 2018, Hut 8 incurred a $4.1 million non-cash decrease on the re-measurement of the value of Bitcoin in inventory, and consequently, finished the quarter with a net loss of approximately $3.8 million. In future quarters, when revenue is recorded, the Company would expect to see unrealized gains or losses based on the price of Bitcoin on the corresponding reporting date, relative to the price on the day mined.\u000a\u000aThis earnings release should be read in conjunction with the Company's Management Discussion & Analysis, Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements for Q1 2018, which have been posted under the Company\u2019s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and are also available on the Company's website at www.hut8mining.com.\u000a\u000aABOUT HUT 8 MINING CORP.\u000a\u000aHut 8 Mining Corp., headquartered in Toronto, Canada is a cryptocurrency mining and blockchain infrastructure company established through an exclusive arrangement with the Bitfury Group, the world\u2019s leading full-service blockchain technology company.

In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances contain forward-looking information. Statements containing forward-looking information are not historical facts but instead represent management\u2019s expectations, estimates and projections regarding future events.\u000a\u000aForward-looking information is necessarily based on a number of opinions, assumptions and estimates that, while considered reasonable by Hut 8 as of the date of this press release, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information, including but not limited to the factors described in greater detail in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of the Filing Statement relating to the Qualifying Transaction of Oriana Resources Corporation and Hut 8, which is available at www.sedar.com. These factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the factors that could affect Hut 8; however, these factors should be considered carefully. There can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will prove to be correct. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are made as of the date of this press release, and Hut 8 expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter statements containing any forward-looking information, or the factors or assumptions underlying them, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\u000a\u000a1 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures and consequently, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income and loss presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial performance measurement. The Company calculates Adjusted EBITDA by adding back to net income (loss): interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and impairment charges as further adjusted to add back stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is provided to investors to supplement the results of operations reported in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing the Company\u2019s financial results with other companies in the industry, many of which also use Adjusted EBITDA in their communications to investors. By excluding non-cash charges such as amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation and impairment charges, as well as non-operating charges for interest and income taxes, investors can evaluate the Company's operations and its ability to generate cash flows from operations and can compare its results on a more consistent basis to the results of other companies in the industry. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to establish internal budgets and goals, and evaluate performance of its business units and management, and evaluate potential acquisitions. The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important indicator of the Company's operational strength and performance of its business and a useful measure of the Company's historical and prospective operating trends. However, there are significant limitations to the use of Adjusted EBITDA since it excludes interest income and expense and income taxes and non-recurring items such as goodwill impairments, each of which impact the Company's profitability and operating cash flows, as well as depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and stock-based compensation. The Company believes that these limitations are compensated by clearly identifying the difference between the two measures. Adjusted EBITDA as defined by the Company may not be comparable with similarly named measures provided by other entities.

(TSX-V:HUT) (\u201cHut 8\u201d, or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a cryptocurrency mining and blockchain infrastructure company established through an exclusive arrangement with the world\u2019s leading full-service blockchain technology company, the Bitfury Group, is pleased to announce its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 (\u201cQ1 2018\u201d). Hut 8 owns Bitcoin mining datacenters called BlockBoxes that are purchased from the Bitfury Group.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Corporate Update</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Andrew Kiguel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hut 8, said: \u201cWe are pleased with the progress Hut 8 has made in a very short period of time. Hut 8 began mining on December 22, 2017 with 7 BlockBoxes in Drumheller, Alberta, with power capacity of 7.7 MW, representing 52.5 PH/s. On February 7, 2018, an additional 10 BlockBoxes were added in Drumheller for an aggregate power capacity of 18.7 MW, representing 128 PH/s. Despite the ramp-up period, in Q1 2018 Hut 8 was able to mine a total of 828 Bitcoin. As of May 24, 2018, Hut 8 has mined in excess of 1,300 Bitcoin which we continue to hold.\u201d</p>\u000a\u000a<p>\u201cWe are excited that our data center build-out in the City of Medicine Hat is well underway. We estimate that full-scale production will commence by September 2018. The City of Medicine Hat site will consist of an additional 40 BlockBoxes. Once operational, Hut 8 will own 57 BlockBoxes, representing a 335% increase from current mining capacity, securing our position as one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners in the world, with a total of 66.7 MW of power capacity and 448 PH/s. With this increase in BlockBoxes from 17 to 57, we expect that our daily mining production will increase significantly. We believe our City of Medicine Hat Facility will represent operational excellence and set a new global benchmark for industrial scale cryptocurrency mining operations,\u201d added Kiguel.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Manufactured by the Bitfury Group, the BlockBoxes are regarded as one of the most powerful and cost-effective Bitcoin mining solutions available on the market. The BlockBoxes are based on cutting-edge hardware and software and are fully configurable and upgradeable to the next generation of silicon technology. The efficient design and low operating cost of the BlockBoxes makes Bitcoin mining more productive and affordable. As previously disclosed, Hut 8 has obtained an exclusive right to all Bitfury Group hardware and software solutions, including the BlockBoxes, for cryptocurrency mining within North America.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Q1 2018 Financial Results</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Q1 2018 represented Hut 8\u2019s first full quarter in operations. With a gross profit margin of 80% (excluding depreciation), the Company\u2019s mining cost-per-bitcoin was $2,615 (US$2,028), which compares favorably to the selling price of Bitcoin at the end of Q1 2018, being $8,991.67 (US$6,973.53).</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The Company believes that Hut 8 is amongst the lowest cost miners of Bitcoin in the world. Hut 8 anticipates its cost per Bitcoin to remain competitive, based on the increasing difficulty rate, offset by the City of Medicine Hat site that will operate more efficiently, next generation BlockBoxes, and a benefit from an improved energy contract for the price of electricity over the Drumheller site.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Selected Financial Highlights from Q1 2018</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Revenues of $10,988,949 Gross profit of $8,823,650 (excluding depreciation) EBITDA1 of $1,824,685 and Adjusted EBITDA1 of $7,690,365 Completion of the Company\u2019s \u201cQualifying Transaction\u201d Raised $70.0 million of equity capital to fund investments and growth Cash balance of $23.7 million and working capital of $19.3 million Mined 828 Bitcoin in Q1 2018, bringing total mined since commencing operations on December 21, 2017 to over 1,300 On February 7, 2018, added 10 new operating BlockBox Data Centers for a total of 17 in operation, representing 18.7 MW / 128 PH/s Purchased 40 additional BlockBoxes to be operational by Q3 2018 representing additional 48 MW / 320 PH/s Entered into definitive agreements with the city of Medicine Hat for the supply of 42 MW of electric energy and the lease of land</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Summary of Q1 2018 Financial Results Revenue $ 10,988,949\u000aGross Profit $ 3,183,181\u000aGross Profit % 29%\u000aGross Profit (excluding depreciation) $ 8,823,650\u000aGross Profit % (excluding depreciation) 80%\u000aOperating income $ 218,701\u000aNet Loss $ (3,815,784 ) EBITDA $ 1,824,685\u000aAdjusted EBITDA* $ 7,690,365\u000aLoss per share $ (0.05 ) * EBITDA adjusted for fair value re-measurement of digital assets, listing expense and one time transactional costs.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>As a result of the decrease in the price of Bitcoin in Q1 2018, Hut 8 incurred a $4.1 million non-cash decrease on the re-measurement of the value of Bitcoin in inventory, and consequently, finished the quarter with a net loss of approximately $3.8 million. In future quarters, when revenue is recorded, the Company would expect to see unrealized gains or losses based on the price of Bitcoin on the corresponding reporting date, relative to the price on the day mined.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>This earnings release should be read in conjunction with the Company&#39;s Management Discussion &amp; Analysis, Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements for Q1 2018, which have been posted under the Company\u2019s profile on SEDAR at <a href="http://www.sedar.com">www.sedar.com</a> and are also available on the Company&#39;s website at <a href="http://www.hut8mining.com">www.hut8mining.com</a>.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>ABOUT HUT 8 MINING CORP.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Hut 8 Mining Corp., headquartered in Toronto, Canada is a cryptocurrency mining and blockchain infrastructure company established through an exclusive arrangement with the Bitfury Group, the world\u2019s leading full-service blockchain technology company.

VI tried being as objective as possible, intentionally avoiding conspiracy theories and some of the uglier sides of the split. I typically try and write for people just getting into Bitcoin and crypto and found that many were confused with why there are "2 Bitcoins."\u000a\u000aCurrently traveling around Asia writing about crypto - please check out my site if you like my writing www.cryptoambit.com \u000a\u000aWould also love to get some discussion going on the post. This was a pretty tough topic to tackle, given how complex the scaling debate and how far back it goes. I definitely oversimplified a lot - would love to hear thoughts! \u000a_____________________________________\u000a**Where Did Bitcoin Cash Come From?**\u000a\u000aStarting to wrap your head around Bitcoin and blockchain? What's this now? Coinbase just abruptly listed something called Bitcoin Cash that temporarily spiked to over $8,000 before they had to suspend trading due to overactivity. Well what the hell is Bitcoin Cash? Simple: it's a fork of Bitcoin. Proper response: what the fork are you talking about? \u000a\u000aBefore we get into exactly what a fork is and how it led to Bitcoin Cash, let's have the cryptocurrency equivalent of the "birds and the bees" talk and discuss how new cryptocurrencies are born.\u000a\u000a**Open Source Code**\u000a\u000aEver wonder why there are so many different cryptocurrencies? This is because Bitcoin software is open-sourced. This means that any programmer can download the Bitcoin source code, make some tweaks and then release it on the internet as a completely new cryptocurrency - an "alt-coin." If that programmer can convince enough miners to dedicate computer resources to maintaining the new coin's blockchain, and if they can convince enough people that their Bitcoin offshoot has value, a new alt coin is born.\u000a\u000aAltcoins have the same basic architecture as Bitcoin. They have miners that run software that maintains a shared history of the altcoin's transactions on a blockchain. These miners are paid in the altcoin as a reward for helping to maintain the blockchain and these rewards circulate new supply of the coin. From that basic framework, programmers get creative. They make new coins that improve speed (Litecoin), that are more anonymous and harder to track (Monero), that have a niche end user in mind (i.e. PotCoin), or that have functions far beyond just being a digital currency (i.e. Ethereum). \u000a\u000aOne of the most successful altcoins is Litecoin. An MIT graduate and Google software developer named Charlie Lee took the Bitcoin source-code and tweaked it. He made a more agile version of Bitcoin by making transaction speeds 4 times faster - new blocks of transactions are added to Litecoin's blockchain every 2.5 minutes compared to every 10 minutes with Bitcoin. \u000a\u000aBitcoin Cash however, was not spawned by some enterprising programmer taking the Bitcoin source-code and starting a new coin from scratch. Bitcoin Cash was created by a faction within the Bitcoin community which disagreed with how Bitcoin was evolving. They gained enough support to split the Bitcoin blockchain in two - the split that created Bitcoin Cash is called a hard fork. \u000a\u000a**The Scaling Debate**\u000a\u000aWhen the Bitcoin network is experiencing heavy traffic, transactions take longer to process and transaction fees paid to miners become more expensive. Transactions are processed once they are added into a new block by a miner - the size of a block is 1 megabyte (MB) which can only fit about 2,500 transactions per block. Blocks are added roughly every 10 minutes so when there are more than 2,500 transactions pending, people have to wait their turn. Miners pick which transactions to include in a new block. If someone wants to get their transaction processed quicker, they can elect to pay a higher fee so that a miner is more likely to select it. When the network is busy, the fee needed to get a transaction processed in a timely manner gets bid up higher and higher (if you use an exchange like Coinbase, they automatically suggest a fee that will get the transaction processed quickly - that fee fluctuates based on current demand on the network).\u000a\u000aWith the popularity of the Bitcoin network at all time highs, so are wait times and transaction fees. Sending $100 USD worth of Bitcoin can cost $30 and take hours to get processed when the network is busy. The development community that collectively updates and improves Bitcoin's open-source code has long known that this would be an issue once a certain level of adoption was reached. The best method for addressing these issues and scaling Bitcoin for a larger user base has been hotly debated for years and ultimately divided the community.\u000a\u000a**Club Blockchain**\u000a\u000aAnalogy time. \u000a\u000aThink of a block in the blockchain as the hottest club in town with limited space (1MB) - transactions are all the people standing in line to get into the club (get processed) and the miner is the bouncer who decides who gets in. Party goers pay a cover charge (transaction fee) to the bouncer to get into the club. The bouncer gives preference to those willing to pay a higher cover charge. When the line to get into the club gets long, people have to pay a higher cover charge to get in. The Bitcoin community came up with two methods to reduce the size of the line and get more people into Club Blockchain at once:\u000a\u000a* **Make the club bigger** - One side wanted to simply make the club bigger. By increasing the size of the club, more people could get in at once. \u000a* **Technical terms** - increase the block size from 1 MB to 8 MB\u000a* **Make the people skinnier**: One side wanted to make each individual party goer skinnier. If all the party goers were skinnier, more of them could fit into the same size club. \u000a* **Technical terms** - SegWit, or segregated witness, is a method for removing some of the data from each transaction, allowing for more transactions to be included in a 1 MB block. \u000a\u000a**A Community Divided**\u000a\u000aSo that's the debate - increase the blocksize or implement a solution that would get more transactions into a 1MB block (SegWit). Sound pretty technical and boring? Well, within the Bitcoin community, the debate got highly contentious and political. \u000a\u000aOpponents to increasing the block size said that an increase would erode Bitcoin's most important feature: decentralization. Increasing the blocksize would greatly increase the computer memory needed, and therefore the cost required to have a computer that validates transactions in the Bitcoin network (a full node). This cost increase would price out most of the smaller operations, leaving the Bitcoin network in the hands of only the most powerful mining pools and companies that could afford it. If control of the Bitcoin network was in the hands of a few, it would be easier for a government or powerful entity to take it over. These opponents favored SegWit as the safest way to scale Bitcoin without compromising decentralization. Many in the SegWit camp were the developers and engineers who prioritized Bitcoin's security and decentralization over the network's ability to process transactions cheaply. \u000a\u000aProponents of increasing the block size argued that Bitcoin was no longer useful in commerce as originally intended in Satoshi Nakamoto's white paper. Since increasing the blocksize would be an immediate remedy to the congestion and high fees, and SegWit would take years to fully cure the issue, they saw a block size increase as the only option. Many in favor of increasing the block size were business owners and entrepreneurs who were transacting in Bitcoin on a regular basis, frustrated by the high fees. \u000a\u000aWhen it became apparent that the majority of the community was in favor of moving foward with SegWit implementation, the wheels of the Bitcoin Cash hard fork were set in motion. \u000a\u000a**Hard Forks**\u000a\u000aA hard fork is the blockchain equivalent of a software update, reserved for serious changes to the network. The Bitcoin network is maintained by computers all over the world collectively updating the Bitcoin blockchain. They are all running software that enables this collaboration. When a significant change needs to be made to how the network functions (i.e. a change in the blocksize), a software update is written and pushed to the computers in the network - it is up to them to download the updated version. \u000a\u000aIf everyone in the network is on board with the change and they all implement it, they can all continue collectively maintaining the blockchain with the change in effect. However, if only half update and half do not, the network becomes out of sync. This causes a chain split, or fork - when the computers update, they begin maintaining a different blockchain from the ones that chose not to update. \u000a\u000aThis is why hard forks are a risky way of introducing changes to a blockchain network. If a change is proposed that not everyone is on board with, the network is at risk of becoming divided. \u000a\u000a**The Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork** \u000a\u000aThe Bitcoin Cash hard fork was what's called a "contentious hard fork." The contingent in favor of increasing the block size knew that they were not going to get the majority of the network to go along with the upgrade. They just had to secure enough miners in the network to go along with the upgrade for their forked version of Bitcoin to maintain value. If they didn't have enough miner support, there would be no one to maintain the network and the 8MB block size version of Bitcoin would have died a quick death. \u000a\u000aOn August 1st 2017, the Bitcoin Cash hard fork happened. A software update including the 8MB blocksize was pushed to the network and it garnered enough support from the mining community. Bitcoin users were told that however many Bitcoins they held at the time of the fork, they now had an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash. Why? Well, remember when I said Litecoin is basically a copy of the Bitcoin source code with some tweaks? Bitcoin Cash is also a tweaked version of the Bitcoin code but, unlike Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash also copied the original Bitcoin blockchain.\u000a\u000aThis means that Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash have a shared transaction history up to August 1. If the Bitcoin blockchain listed your address as having 1 Bitcoin on August 1, the forked Bitcoin Cash blockchain would indicate the same thing. After August 1, the miners in the network that upgraded to the 8MB began maintaing the Bitcoin Cash blockchain while the miners who did not upgrade continued maintaining the original Bitcoin blockchain - on that date, the Bitcoin blockchain "forked" into two.\u000a\u000a**After The Fork**\u000a\u000aAt the time of the fork, no one was really sure what was going to happen with Bitcoin Cash. It was dismissed by many as a gimmick that would be worthless in a matter of months. At the same time, since every person holding Bitcoin was gifted an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash, many people had an automatic interest in its value. At the time of the hard fork, the value of Bitcoin Cash set by the free market was around $300 dollars, compared to Bitcoin's $2,700 price tag. \u000a\u000aDespite many detractors, there was also a vocal group of Bitcoin Cash supporters who began calling for "The Flippening" - a prediction that Bitcoin Cash would overtake the original Bitcoin in value. They argued that Bitcoin had lost its way and was no longer useable as a currency due to its high fees - they claimed that Bitcoin Cash was the "real Bitcoin" since it was more in line with Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision. People reacted to these projections and, during the month of August Bitcoin Cash's value was bid up 300% to $900. This price hike was short lived and the value soon returned to $300.\u000a\u000aOnce again, in November 2017, calls for The Flippening grew louder when an initiative to scale Bitcoin (called Segwit2x, not to be confused with SegWit, goddam its all so confusing) was called off due to lack of consensus in the community. Bitcoin Cash supporters cited this initiative's failure as further evidence that Bitcoin would never scale. The movement gained steam when programmer Gavin Anderson - who Satoshi Nakamoto left as Bitcoin's lead developer before he disappeared - stated that Bitcoin Cash more closely resembled the project he began working on in 2010. Bitcoin Cash's value shot up to $1,800 while Bitcoin's fell from $7,500 to $5,800. Bitcoin Cash settled around $1,200 while Bitcoin rebounded and continued its ascent to it's 2017 peak of $20,000. \u000a\u000aThe latest Bitcoin Cash boom came on December 20th 2017 when Coinbase, the most popular cryptocurrency exchange, made a surprise announcement that it would enable Bitcoin Cash trading. People looking to cash in on the latest coming of "The Flippening" flooded Coinbase with buy orders, bidding the price up as high as $9,000 - this coincided with a 10% dip in Bitcoin as it fell below $12,000.  Unable to handle the traffic, Coinbase temporarily halted trading, freezing the price at $8,000. When Coinbase resumed trading, the price fell back below $3,000. Amid heavy criticism, Coinbase had to launch an internal investigation into potential insider trading, since the price in Bitcoin Cash started soaring before it was announced that Coinbase would support Bitcoin Cash trading. \u000a\u000a**Is Bitcoin Cash Actually Better?**\u000a\u000aCurrently, transacting in Bitcoin Cash is significantly cheaper than Bitcoin, with average transaction fees at $0.32 vs $26.27 at the time of this writing. Since more transactions can be included in a single block, transactions will also get included in a block and processed quicker. However, the Bitcoin Cash network only handles about 12% of the daily transactions that Bitcoin is saddled with. Its difficult to know how exactly the Bitcoin Cash network would respond if faced with a heavier load. At this point, it is just too early to tell. \u000a\u000a**What's Bitcoin's Plan?**\u000a\u000aSegWit has been implemented within the Bitcoin network through what's called a soft fork - contrary to a hard fork, soft fork changes can be rolled out to the network without causing a chain split. However, the potential benefits of Segwit will not be realized until SegWit is activated by those using the Bitcoin network. To go back to our earlier analogy, in order for Segwit to "make the transactions skinnier", the applications that generate Bitcoin transactions need to weave it into their systems. Coinbase, for example, has not yet done this so the thousands of daily transactions they send over the Bitcoin Blockchain are "fat" and do not help alleviate the congestion. For the fruits of SegWit to be realized, it will need heavier levels of adoption amongst Bitcoin exchanges and wallet developers - something the Bitcoin core developers will continue to push for in 2018. \u000a\u000aSegWit adoption is phase 1 in Bitcoin's long term plan for scalability. Once SegWit has been adopted, Bitcoin will focus on implementing what's called the Lightning Network. The Lightning Network is a "layer 2" solution that will enable thousands of Bitcoin transactions to take place outside of the Bitcoin blockchain with minimal fees - at regular intervals, the sum of those transactions will settle on the Bitcoin blockchain. A full explanation of how Lightning works merits another post but many in the Bitcoin development community see great promise in it. \u000a\u000aIt is going to take time to implement these solutions and, given Bitcoin's explosion in popularity, the network will remain congested in the near future. This means fees and wait times will remain high for now. Further adoption of SegWit and a successful roll out of The Lightning Network will be needed to quiet Bitcoin's doubters. In the meantime, Bitcoin more effectively functions as a "store of value" and is better suited for moving large amounts of value and is unsuitable for small transactions.     \u000a\u000a**Who Will Win?**\u000a\u000aBitcoin's current issues with speed and transactions fees are a function of its popularity. A common metaphor used to described the current state of Bitcoin is "the restaurant that no one goes to anymore because its too crowded."\u000a\u000aMany on the internet are pronouncing Bitcoin dead because of these issues. A look back into Bitcoin's short history are filled with proclamations of its demise; to date, none of those predictions have come true. Bitcoin, at its core is a technology - technologies don't remain as they are so long as there are people dedicated to pushing them forward. Bitcoin has highly talented and dedicated developers around the world committed to improving it - as long as they exist, Bitcoin has a chance. \u000a\u000aEnough people have also disagreed with the direction that the Bitcoin developers have taken the project. Those people have put their efforts and support behind Bitcoin Cash. The success of Bitcoin Cash will equally depend on their ability to move the project forward.\u000a\u000aSo who will win? No one knows and anyone telling you that they do, probably has an agenda. Maybe they coexist, maybe neither exists 10 years from now. The whole point of Bitcoin was to give people the option of a currency that exists outside of governments. Turns out, it also spawned thousands of options outside of Bitcoin itself - Bitcoin Cash is one of many. Freedom to choose will never be a bad thing so its up to people to do their own diligence an support the projects that most closely align with their own beliefs and values. Ultimately, the free market will decide.

V<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I tried being as objective as possible, intentionally avoiding conspiracy theories and some of the uglier sides of the split. I typically try and write for people just getting into Bitcoin and crypto and found that many were confused with why there are &quot;2 Bitcoins.&quot;</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Currently traveling around Asia writing about crypto - please check out my site if you like my writing <a href="http://www.cryptoambit.com">www.cryptoambit.com</a> </p>\u000a\u000a<p>Would also love to get some discussion going on the post. This was a pretty tough topic to tackle, given how complex the scaling debate and how far back it goes. I definitely oversimplified a lot - would love to hear thoughts! </p>\u000a\u000a<hr/>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>Where Did Bitcoin Cash Come From?</strong></p>\u000a\u000a<p>Starting to wrap your head around Bitcoin and blockchain? What&#39;s this now? Coinbase just abruptly listed something called Bitcoin Cash that temporarily spiked to over $8,000 before they had to suspend trading due to overactivity. Well what the hell is Bitcoin Cash? Simple: it&#39;s a fork of Bitcoin. Proper response: what the fork are you talking about? </p>\u000a\u000a<p>Before we get into exactly what a fork is and how it led to Bitcoin Cash, let&#39;s have the cryptocurrency equivalent of the &quot;birds and the bees&quot; talk and discuss how new cryptocurrencies are born.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>Open Source Code</strong></p>\u000a\u000a<p>Ever wonder why there are so many different cryptocurrencies? This is because Bitcoin software is open-sourced. This means that any programmer can download the Bitcoin source code, make some tweaks and then release it on the internet as a completely new cryptocurrency - an &quot;alt-coin.&quot; If that programmer can convince enough miners to dedicate computer resources to maintaining the new coin&#39;s blockchain, and if they can convince enough people that their Bitcoin offshoot has value, a new alt coin is born.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Altcoins have the same basic architecture as Bitcoin. They have miners that run software that maintains a shared history of the altcoin&#39;s transactions on a blockchain. These miners are paid in the altcoin as a reward for helping to maintain the blockchain and these rewards circulate new supply of the coin. From that basic framework, programmers get creative. They make new coins that improve speed (Litecoin), that are more anonymous and harder to track (Monero), that have a niche end user in mind (i.e. PotCoin), or that have functions far beyond just being a digital currency (i.e. Ethereum). </p>\u000a\u000a<p>One of the most successful altcoins is Litecoin. An MIT graduate and Google software developer named Charlie Lee took the Bitcoin source-code and tweaked it. He made a more agile version of Bitcoin by making transaction speeds 4 times faster - new blocks of transactions are added to Litecoin&#39;s blockchain every 2.5 minutes compared to every 10 minutes with Bitcoin. </p>\u000a\u000a<p>Bitcoin Cash however, was not spawned by some enterprising programmer taking the Bitcoin source-code and starting a new coin from scratch. Bitcoin Cash was created by a faction within the Bitcoin community which disagreed with how Bitcoin was evolving. They gained enough support to split the Bitcoin blockchain in two - the split that created Bitcoin Cash is called a hard fork. </p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>The Scaling Debate</strong></p>\u000a\u000a<p>When the Bitcoin network is experiencing heavy traffic, transactions take longer to process and transaction fees paid to miners become more expensive. Transactions are processed once they are added into a new block by a miner - the size of a block is 1 megabyte (MB) which can only fit about 2,500 transactions per block. Blocks are added roughly every 10 minutes so when there are more than 2,500 transactions pending, people have to wait their turn. Miners pick which transactions to include in a new block. If someone wants to get their transaction processed quicker, they can elect to pay a higher fee so that a miner is more likely to select it. When the network is busy, the fee needed to get a transaction processed in a timely manner gets bid up higher and higher (if you use an exchange like Coinbase, they automatically suggest a fee that will get the transaction processed quickly - that fee fluctuates based on current demand on the network).</p>\u000a\u000a<p>With the popularity of the Bitcoin network at all time highs, so are wait times and transaction fees. Sending $100 USD worth of Bitcoin can cost $30 and take hours to get processed when the network is busy. The development community that collectively updates and improves Bitcoin&#39;s open-source code has long known that this would be an issue once a certain level of adoption was reached. The best method for addressing these issues and scaling Bitcoin for a larger user base has been hotly debated for years and ultimately divided the community.</p>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>Club Blockchain</strong></p>\u000a\u000a<p>Analogy time. </p>\u000a\u000a<p>Think of a block in the blockchain as the hottest club in town with limited space (1MB) - transactions are all the people standing in line to get into the club (get processed) and the miner is the bouncer who decides who gets in. Party goers pay a cover charge (transaction fee) to the bouncer to get into the club. The bouncer gives preference to those willing to pay a higher cover charge. When the line to get into the club gets long, people have to pay a higher cover charge to get in. The Bitcoin community came up with two methods to reduce the size of the line and get more people into Club Blockchain at once:</p>\u000a\u000a<ul>\u000a<li><strong>Make the club bigger</strong> - One side wanted to simply make the club bigger. By increasing the size of the club, more people could get in at once. </li>\u000a<li><strong>Technical terms</strong> - increase the block size from 1 MB to 8 MB</li>\u000a<li><strong>Make the people skinnier</strong>: One side wanted to make each individual party goer skinnier. If all the party goers were skinnier, more of them could fit into the same size club. </li>\u000a<li><strong>Technical terms</strong> - SegWit, or segregated witness, is a method for removing some of the data from each transaction, allowing for more transactions to be included in a 1 MB block. </li>\u000a</ul>\u000a\u000a<p><strong>A Community Divided</strong></p>\u000a\u000a<p>So that&#39;s the debate - increase the blocksize or implement a solution that would get more transactions into a 1MB block (SegWit).

Bitcoin, at its core is a technology - technologies don&#39;t remain as they are so long as there are people dedicated to pushing them forward. Bitcoin has highly talented and dedicated developers around the world committed to improving it - as long as they exist, Bitcoin has a chance. </p>\u000a\u000a<p>Enough people have also disagreed with the direction that the Bitcoin developers have taken the project. Those people have put their efforts and support behind Bitcoin Cash. The success of Bitcoin Cash will equally depend on their ability to move the project forward.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>So who will win? No one knows and anyone telling you that they do, probably has an agenda. Maybe they coexist, maybe neither exists 10 years from now. The whole point of Bitcoin was to give people the option of a currency that exists outside of governments. Turns out, it also spawned thousands of options outside of Bitcoin itself - Bitcoin Cash is one of many. Freedom to choose will never be a bad thing so its up to people to do their own diligence an support the projects that most closely align with their own beliefs and values. Ultimately, the free market will decide.</p>\u000a</div><!-- SC_ON -->

VNewbs might not know this, but bitcoin recently came out of an intense internal drama. Between July 2015 and August 2017 bitcoin was attacked by external forces who were hoping to destroy the very properties that made bitcoin valuable in the first place. This culminated in the creation of segwit and the UASF (user activated soft fork) movement. The UASF was successful, segwit was added to bitcoin and with that the anti-decentralization side left bitcoin altogether and created their own altcoin called bcash. Bitcoin's price was $2500, soon after segwit was activated the price doubled to $5000 and continued rising until a top of $20000 before correcting to where we are today.\u000a\u000aDuring this drama, I took time away from writing open source code to help educate and argue on reddit, twitter and other social media. I came up with a reading list for quickly copypasting things. It may be interesting today for newbs or anyone who wants a history lesson on what exactly happened during those two years when bitcoin's very existence as a decentralized low-trust currency was questioned. Now the fight has essentially been won, I try not to comment on reddit that much anymore. There's nothing left to do except wait for Lightning and similar tech to become mature (or better yet, [help code it and test it](http://lightning.network/))\u000a\u000aIn this thread you can learn about block sizes, latency, decentralization, segwit, ASICBOOST, lightning network and all the other issues that were debated endlessly for over two years. So when someone tries to get you to invest in bcash, remind them of the time they supported Bitcoin Unlimited.\u000a\u000aFor more threads like this see r/UASF\u000a\u000a# Summary / The fundamental tradeoff\u000a\u000aA trip to the moon requires a rocket with multiple stages by gmaxwell (must read)\u000ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/438hx0/a_trip_to_the_moon_requires_a_rocket_with/\u000a\u000aBram Cohen, creator of bittorrent, argues against a hard fork to a larger block size\u000ahttps://medium.com/@bramcohen/bitcoin-s-ironic-crisis-32226a85e39f#.558vetum4\u000a\u000agmaxwell's summary of the debate\u000ahttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1343716.msg13701818#msg13701818\u000a\u000aCore devs please explain your vision (see luke's post which also argues that blocks are already too big)\u000ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/61yvvv/request_to_core_devs_please_explain_your_vision/\u000a\u000aMod of r/btc speaking against a hard fork\u000ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/57hd14/core_reaction_to_viabtc_this_week/d8scokm/ \u000a\u000aIt's becoming clear to me that a lot of people don't understand how fragile bitcoin is \u000ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/59kflj/its_becoming_clear_to_me_that_a_lot_of_people/\u000a\u000aBlockchain space must be costly, it can never be free\u000ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4og24h/i_just_attended_the_distributed_trade_conference/\u000a\u000aCharlie Lee with a nice analogy about the fundamental tradeoff\u000ahttps://medium.com/@SatoshiLite/eating-the-bitcoin-cake-fc2b4ebfb85e#.444vr8shw\u000a\u000agmaxwell on the tradeoffs\u000ahttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1520693.msg15303746#msg15303746\u000a\u000ajratcliff on the layering https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/59upyh/segwit_the_poison_pill_for_bitcoin/d9bstuw/\u000a\u000a# Scaling on-chain will destroy bitcoin's decentralization\u000a\u000aPeter Todd: How a floating blocksize limit inevitably leads towards centralization [Feb 2013]\u000ahttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=144895.0 mailing list https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-February/002176.html with discussion on reddit in Aug 2015 https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3hnvi8/just_a_little_history_lesson_for_everyone_new_the/\u000a\u000aNick Szabo's blog post on what makes bitcoin so special\u000ahttp://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html\u000a\u000aThere is academic research showing that even small (2MB) increases to the blocksize results in drastic node dropoff counts due to the non-linear increase of RAM needed.\u000ahttp://bravenewcoin.com/assets/Whitepapers/block-size-1.1.1.pdf\u000a\u000aReddit summary of above link.

V<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Newbs might not know this, but bitcoin recently came out of an intense internal drama. Between July 2015 and August 2017 bitcoin was attacked by external forces who were hoping to destroy the very properties that made bitcoin valuable in the first place. This culminated in the creation of segwit and the UASF (user activated soft fork) movement. The UASF was successful, segwit was added to bitcoin and with that the anti-decentralization side left bitcoin altogether and created their own altcoin called bcash. Bitcoin&#39;s price was $2500, soon after segwit was activated the price doubled to $5000 and continued rising until a top of $20000 before correcting to where we are today.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>During this drama, I took time away from writing open source code to help educate and argue on reddit, twitter and other social media. I came up with a reading list for quickly copypasting things. It may be interesting today for newbs or anyone who wants a history lesson on what exactly happened during those two years when bitcoin&#39;s very existence as a decentralized low-trust currency was questioned. Now the fight has essentially been won, I try not to comment on reddit that much anymore. There&#39;s nothing left to do except wait for Lightning and similar tech to become mature (or better yet, <a href="http://lightning.network/">help code it and test it</a>)</p>\u000a\u000a<p>In this thread you can learn about block sizes, latency, decentralization, segwit, ASICBOOST, lightning network and all the other issues that were debated endlessly for over two years. So when someone tries to get you to invest in bcash, remind them of the time they supported Bitcoin Unlimited.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>For more threads like this see <a href="/r/UASF">r/UASF</a></p>\u000a\u000a<h1>Summary / The fundamental tradeoff</h1>\u000a\u000a<p>A trip to the moon requires a rocket with multiple stages by gmaxwell (must read)\u000a<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/438hx0/a_trip_to_the_moon_requires_a_rocket_with/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/438hx0/a_trip_to_the_moon_requires_a_rocket_with/</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>Bram Cohen, creator of bittorrent, argues against a hard fork to a larger block size\u000a<a href="https://medium.com/@bramcohen/bitcoin-s-ironic-crisis-32226a85e39f#.558vetum4">https://medium.com/@bramcohen/bitcoin-s-ironic-crisis-32226a85e39f#.558vetum4</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>gmaxwell&#39;s summary of the debate\u000a<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1343716.msg13701818#msg13701818">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1343716.msg13701818#msg13701818</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>Core devs please explain your vision (see luke&#39;s post which also argues that blocks are already too big)\u000a<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/61yvvv/request_to_core_devs_please_explain_your_vision/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/61yvvv/request_to_core_devs_please_explain_your_vision/</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>Mod of <a href="/r/btc">r/btc</a> speaking against a hard fork\u000a<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/57hd14/core_reaction_to_viabtc_this_week/d8scokm/">https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/57hd14/core_reaction_to_viabtc_this_week/d8scokm/</a> </p>\u000a\u000a<p>It&#39;s becoming clear to me that a lot of people don&#39;t understand how fragile bitcoin is \u000a<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/59kflj/its_becoming_clear_to_me_that_a_lot_of_people/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/59kflj/its_becoming_clear_to_me_that_a_lot_of_people/</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>Blockchain space must be costly, it can never be free\u000a<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4og24h/i_just_attended_the_distributed_trade_conference/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4og24h/i_just_attended_the_distributed_trade_conference/</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>Charlie Lee with a nice analogy about the fundamental tradeoff\u000a<a href="https://medium.com/@SatoshiLite/eating-the-bitcoin-cake-fc2b4ebfb85e#.444vr8shw">https://medium.com/@SatoshiLite/eating-the-bitcoin-cake-fc2b4ebfb85e#.444vr8shw</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>gmaxwell on the tradeoffs\u000a<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1520693.msg15303746#msg15303746">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1520693.msg15303746#msg15303746</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>jratcliff on the layering <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/59upyh/segwit_the_poison_pill_for_bitcoin/d9bstuw/">https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/59upyh/segwit_the_poison_pill_for_bitcoin/d9bstuw/</a></p>\u000a\u000a<h1>Scaling on-chain will destroy bitcoin&#39;s decentralization</h1>\u000a\u000a<p>Peter Todd: How a floating blocksize limit inevitably leads towards centralization [Feb 2013]\u000a<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=144895.0">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=144895.0</a> mailing list <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-February/002176.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-February/002176.html</a> with discussion on reddit in Aug 2015 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3hnvi8/just_a_little_history_lesson_for_everyone_new_the/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3hnvi8/just_a_little_history_lesson_for_everyone_new_the/</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>Nick Szabo&#39;s blog post on what makes bitcoin so special\u000a<a href="http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html">http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>There is academic research showing that even small (2MB) increases to the blocksize results in drastic node dropoff counts due to the non-linear increase of RAM needed.\u000a<a href="http://bravenewcoin.com/assets/Whitepapers/block-size-1.1.1.pdf">http://bravenewcoin.com/assets/Whitepapers/block-size-1.1.1.pdf</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>Reddit summary of above link.

VFor 2 days in a row transactions are at the highest levels since Jan 17th 2018.\u000aThe past 24hrs is currently 289,053 and Jan 17th had 309,485 confirmed transactions. \u000a\u000aThe importance of this becomes especially clear when we consider that back in January very few firms were batching transactions together. Coinbase for example, was not batching transactions together until 3 months later.\u000a\u000aTo be clear the markets were very active in January.\u000a\u000aSince batching brought the metric of confirmed transactions down drastically in the spring the number of on chain transactions has steadily climbed since late March with lows in the 135,500 range. \u000a\u000aTransactions have climbed month after month, which  indicates more and more that Bitcoin is being used.\u000a\u000aAlso side chains like Lightning network have likely put some downward pressure on the number of confirmed on chain transactions, simply because many of these transactions take place off chain and are settled on chain. We can likely expect other projects like Liquid to reduce on chain transactions too. Which makes it all the more remarkable that transactions on chain are gaining steam so much.\u000a\u000aThe slowest day for Bitcoin transactions is almost always on Sunday, we can see the charts dip every Sunday to the lowest point of the week.  But what's really remarkable is that the Sunday numbers are constantly increasing too!\u000a\u000aI've posted about this trend twice before over the last few months but this is now becoming really really  obvious to anyone looking at the charts.\u000a\u000aYes we can talk about outputs instead of transactions,  but that metric is increasing too. Both are bullish signs that people are using Bitcoin more and more. \u000a\u000aOther metrics too, the blocks are near capacity much more and show an increase since the spring, especially since August.\u000a\u000aBut it's the increasing daily on chain transactions that really really are starting to stand out. Because side chains and batching are reducing the number of on chain transactions...yet its "supposedly" a bear market.\u000a\u000aI'd love to see more discussion around this topic.

VNewbs might not know this, but bitcoin recently came out of an intense internal drama. Between July 2015 and August 2017 bitcoin was attacked by external forces who were hoping to destroy the very properties that made bitcoin valuable in the first place. This culminated in the creation of segwit and the UASF (user activated soft fork) movement. The UASF was successful, segwit was added to bitcoin and with that the anti-decentralization side left bitcoin altogether and created their own altcoin called bcash. Bitcoin's price was $2500, soon after segwit was activated the price doubled to $5000 and continued rising until a top of $20000 before correcting to where we are today.\u000a\u000aDuring this drama, I took time away from writing open source code to help educate and argue on reddit, twitter and other social media. I came up with a reading list for quickly copypasting things. It may be interesting today for newbs or anyone who wants a history lesson on what exactly happened during those two years when bitcoin's very existence as a decentralized low-trust currency was questioned. Now the fight has essentially been won, I try not to comment on reddit that much anymore. There's nothing left to do except wait for Lightning and similar tech to become mature (or better yet, [help code it and test it](http://lightning.network/))\u000a\u000aIn this thread you can learn about block sizes, latency, decentralization, segwit, ASICBOOST, lightning network and all the other issues that were debated endlessly for over two years. So when someone tries to get you to invest in bcash, remind them of the time they supported Bitcoin Unlimited.\u000a\u000aFor more threads like this see r/UASF\u000a\u000a# Summary / The fundamental tradeoff\u000a\u000aA trip to the moon requires a rocket with multiple stages by gmaxwell (must read)\u000ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/438hx0/a_trip_to_the_moon_requires_a_rocket_with/\u000a\u000aBram Cohen, creator of bittorrent, argues against a hard fork to a larger block size\u000ahttps://medium.com/@bramcohen/bitcoin-s-ironic-crisis-32226a85e39f#.558vetum4\u000a\u000agmaxwell's summary of the debate\u000ahttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1343716.msg13701818#msg13701818\u000a\u000aCore devs please explain your vision (see luke's post which also argues that blocks are already too big)\u000ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/61yvvv/request_to_core_devs_please_explain_your_vision/\u000a\u000aMod of r/btc speaking against a hard fork\u000ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/57hd14/core_reaction_to_viabtc_this_week/d8scokm/ \u000a\u000aIt's becoming clear to me that a lot of people don't understand how fragile bitcoin is \u000ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/59kflj/its_becoming_clear_to_me_that_a_lot_of_people/\u000a\u000aBlockchain space must be costly, it can never be free\u000ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4og24h/i_just_attended_the_distributed_trade_conference/\u000a\u000aCharlie Lee with a nice analogy about the fundamental tradeoff\u000ahttps://medium.com/@SatoshiLite/eating-the-bitcoin-cake-fc2b4ebfb85e#.444vr8shw\u000a\u000agmaxwell on the tradeoffs\u000ahttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1520693.msg15303746#msg15303746\u000a\u000ajratcliff on the layering https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/59upyh/segwit_the_poison_pill_for_bitcoin/d9bstuw/\u000a\u000a# Scaling on-chain will destroy bitcoin's decentralization\u000a\u000aPeter Todd: How a floating blocksize limit inevitably leads towards centralization [Feb 2013]\u000ahttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=144895.0 mailing list https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-February/002176.html with discussion on reddit in Aug 2015 https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3hnvi8/just_a_little_history_lesson_for_everyone_new_the/\u000a\u000aNick Szabo's blog post on what makes bitcoin so special\u000ahttp://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html\u000a\u000aThere is academic research showing that even small (2MB) increases to the blocksize results in drastic node dropoff counts due to the non-linear increase of RAM needed.\u000ahttp://bravenewcoin.com/assets/Whitepapers/block-size-1.1.1.pdf\u000a\u000aReddit summary of above link.

V<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Newbs might not know this, but bitcoin recently came out of an intense internal drama. Between July 2015 and August 2017 bitcoin was attacked by external forces who were hoping to destroy the very properties that made bitcoin valuable in the first place. This culminated in the creation of segwit and the UASF (user activated soft fork) movement. The UASF was successful, segwit was added to bitcoin and with that the anti-decentralization side left bitcoin altogether and created their own altcoin called bcash. Bitcoin&#39;s price was $2500, soon after segwit was activated the price doubled to $5000 and continued rising until a top of $20000 before correcting to where we are today.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>During this drama, I took time away from writing open source code to help educate and argue on reddit, twitter and other social media. I came up with a reading list for quickly copypasting things. It may be interesting today for newbs or anyone who wants a history lesson on what exactly happened during those two years when bitcoin&#39;s very existence as a decentralized low-trust currency was questioned. Now the fight has essentially been won, I try not to comment on reddit that much anymore. There&#39;s nothing left to do except wait for Lightning and similar tech to become mature (or better yet, <a href="http://lightning.network/">help code it and test it</a>)</p>\u000a\u000a<p>In this thread you can learn about block sizes, latency, decentralization, segwit, ASICBOOST, lightning network and all the other issues that were debated endlessly for over two years. So when someone tries to get you to invest in bcash, remind them of the time they supported Bitcoin Unlimited.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>For more threads like this see <a href="/r/UASF">r/UASF</a></p>\u000a\u000a<h1>Summary / The fundamental tradeoff</h1>\u000a\u000a<p>A trip to the moon requires a rocket with multiple stages by gmaxwell (must read)\u000a<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/438hx0/a_trip_to_the_moon_requires_a_rocket_with/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/438hx0/a_trip_to_the_moon_requires_a_rocket_with/</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>Bram Cohen, creator of bittorrent, argues against a hard fork to a larger block size\u000a<a href="https://medium.com/@bramcohen/bitcoin-s-ironic-crisis-32226a85e39f#.558vetum4">https://medium.com/@bramcohen/bitcoin-s-ironic-crisis-32226a85e39f#.558vetum4</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>gmaxwell&#39;s summary of the debate\u000a<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1343716.msg13701818#msg13701818">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1343716.msg13701818#msg13701818</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>Core devs please explain your vision (see luke&#39;s post which also argues that blocks are already too big)\u000a<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/61yvvv/request_to_core_devs_please_explain_your_vision/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/61yvvv/request_to_core_devs_please_explain_your_vision/</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>Mod of <a href="/r/btc">r/btc</a> speaking against a hard fork\u000a<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/57hd14/core_reaction_to_viabtc_this_week/d8scokm/">https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/57hd14/core_reaction_to_viabtc_this_week/d8scokm/</a> </p>\u000a\u000a<p>It&#39;s becoming clear to me that a lot of people don&#39;t understand how fragile bitcoin is \u000a<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/59kflj/its_becoming_clear_to_me_that_a_lot_of_people/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/59kflj/its_becoming_clear_to_me_that_a_lot_of_people/</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>Blockchain space must be costly, it can never be free\u000a<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4og24h/i_just_attended_the_distributed_trade_conference/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4og24h/i_just_attended_the_distributed_trade_conference/</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>Charlie Lee with a nice analogy about the fundamental tradeoff\u000a<a href="https://medium.com/@SatoshiLite/eating-the-bitcoin-cake-fc2b4ebfb85e#.444vr8shw">https://medium.com/@SatoshiLite/eating-the-bitcoin-cake-fc2b4ebfb85e#.444vr8shw</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>gmaxwell on the tradeoffs\u000a<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1520693.msg15303746#msg15303746">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1520693.msg15303746#msg15303746</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>jratcliff on the layering <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/59upyh/segwit_the_poison_pill_for_bitcoin/d9bstuw/">https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/59upyh/segwit_the_poison_pill_for_bitcoin/d9bstuw/</a></p>\u000a\u000a<h1>Scaling on-chain will destroy bitcoin&#39;s decentralization</h1>\u000a\u000a<p>Peter Todd: How a floating blocksize limit inevitably leads towards centralization [Feb 2013]\u000a<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=144895.0">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=144895.0</a> mailing list <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-February/002176.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2013-February/002176.html</a> with discussion on reddit in Aug 2015 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3hnvi8/just_a_little_history_lesson_for_everyone_new_the/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3hnvi8/just_a_little_history_lesson_for_everyone_new_the/</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>Nick Szabo&#39;s blog post on what makes bitcoin so special\u000a<a href="http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html">http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2017/02/money-blockchains-and-social-scalability.html</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>There is academic research showing that even small (2MB) increases to the blocksize results in drastic node dropoff counts due to the non-linear increase of RAM needed.\u000a<a href="http://bravenewcoin.com/assets/Whitepapers/block-size-1.1.1.pdf">http://bravenewcoin.com/assets/Whitepapers/block-size-1.1.1.pdf</a></p>\u000a\u000a<p>Reddit summary of above link.

VHut 8 Mining Corp. Announces First Quarter 2018 Financial Results\u000a\u000aAll Figures in Canadian Dollars Unless Otherwise Noted\u000a\u000aCompany raised $70.0 million to fund investment in mining hardware Entered into definitive agreement with the City of Medicine Hat for the supply of 42 MW of electric energy First quarter 2018 revenue of $10,988,949 Strong gross profit margin of 80%, or $8,823,650 (excluding depreciation) Adjusted EBITDA of $7,690,365 828 Bitcoin mined in Q1\u000a\u000aTORONTO, May 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hut 8 Mining Corp. (TSX-V:HUT) (\u201cHut 8\u201d, or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a cryptocurrency mining and blockchain infrastructure company established through an exclusive arrangement with the world\u2019s leading full-service blockchain technology company, the Bitfury Group, is pleased to announce its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 (\u201cQ1 2018\u201d). Hut 8 owns Bitcoin mining datacenters called BlockBoxes that are purchased from the Bitfury Group.\u000a\u000aCorporate Update\u000a\u000aAndrew Kiguel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hut 8, said: \u201cWe are pleased with the progress Hut 8 has made in a very short period of time. Hut 8 began mining on December 22, 2017 with 7 BlockBoxes in Drumheller, Alberta, with power capacity of 7.7 MW, representing 52.5 PH/s. On February 7, 2018, an additional 10 BlockBoxes were added in Drumheller for an aggregate power capacity of 18.7 MW, representing 128 PH/s. Despite the ramp-up period, in Q1 2018 Hut 8 was able to mine a total of 828 Bitcoin. As of May 24, 2018, Hut 8 has mined in excess of 1,300 Bitcoin which we continue to hold.\u201d\u000a\u000a\u201cWe are excited that our data center build-out in the City of Medicine Hat is well underway. We estimate that full-scale production will commence by September 2018. The City of Medicine Hat site will consist of an additional 40 BlockBoxes. Once operational, Hut 8 will own 57 BlockBoxes, representing a 335% increase from current mining capacity, securing our position as one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners in the world, with a total of 66.7 MW of power capacity and 448 PH/s. With this increase in BlockBoxes from 17 to 57, we expect that our daily mining production will increase significantly. We believe our City of Medicine Hat Facility will represent operational excellence and set a new global benchmark for industrial scale cryptocurrency mining operations,\u201d added Kiguel.\u000a\u000aManufactured by the Bitfury Group, the BlockBoxes are regarded as one of the most powerful and cost-effective Bitcoin mining solutions available on the market. The BlockBoxes are based on cutting-edge hardware and software and are fully configurable and upgradeable to the next generation of silicon technology. The efficient design and low operating cost of the BlockBoxes makes Bitcoin mining more productive and affordable. As previously disclosed, Hut 8 has obtained an exclusive right to all Bitfury Group hardware and software solutions, including the BlockBoxes, for cryptocurrency mining within North America.\u000a\u000aQ1 2018 Financial Results\u000a\u000aQ1 2018 represented Hut 8\u2019s first full quarter in operations. With a gross profit margin of 80% (excluding depreciation), the Company\u2019s mining cost-per-bitcoin was $2,615 (US$2,028), which compares favorably to the selling price of Bitcoin at the end of Q1 2018, being $8,991.67 (US$6,973.53).\u000a\u000aThe Company believes that Hut 8 is amongst the lowest cost miners of Bitcoin in the world. Hut 8 anticipates its cost per Bitcoin to remain competitive, based on the increasing difficulty rate, offset by the City of Medicine Hat site that will operate more efficiently, next generation BlockBoxes, and a benefit from an improved energy contract for the price of electricity over the Drumheller site.\u000a\u000aSelected Financial Highlights from Q1 2018\u000a\u000aRevenues of $10,988,949 Gross profit of $8,823,650 (excluding depreciation) EBITDA1 of $1,824,685 and Adjusted EBITDA1 of $7,690,365 Completion of the Company\u2019s \u201cQualifying Transaction\u201d Raised $70.0 million of equity capital to fund investments and growth Cash balance of $23.7 million and working capital of $19.3 million Mined 828 Bitcoin in Q1 2018, bringing total mined since commencing operations on December 21, 2017 to over 1,300 On February 7, 2018, added 10 new operating BlockBox Data Centers for a total of 17 in operation, representing 18.7 MW / 128 PH/s Purchased 40 additional BlockBoxes to be operational by Q3 2018 representing additional 48 MW / 320 PH/s Entered into definitive agreements with the city of Medicine Hat for the supply of 42 MW of electric energy and the lease of land\u000a\u000aSummary of Q1 2018 Financial Results Revenue $ 10,988,949\u000aGross Profit $ 3,183,181\u000aGross Profit % 29%\u000aGross Profit (excluding depreciation) $ 8,823,650\u000aGross Profit % (excluding depreciation) 80%\u000aOperating income $ 218,701\u000aNet Loss $ (3,815,784 ) EBITDA $ 1,824,685\u000aAdjusted EBITDA* $ 7,690,365\u000aLoss per share $ (0.05 ) * EBITDA adjusted for fair value re-measurement of digital assets, listing expense and one time transactional costs.\u000a\u000aAs a result of the decrease in the price of Bitcoin in Q1 2018, Hut 8 incurred a $4.1 million non-cash decrease on the re-measurement of the value of Bitcoin in inventory, and consequently, finished the quarter with a net loss of approximately $3.8 million. In future quarters, when revenue is recorded, the Company would expect to see unrealized gains or losses based on the price of Bitcoin on the corresponding reporting date, relative to the price on the day mined.\u000a\u000aThis earnings release should be read in conjunction with the Company's Management Discussion & Analysis, Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements for Q1 2018, which have been posted under the Company\u2019s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and are also available on the Company's website at www.hut8mining.com.\u000a\u000aABOUT HUT 8 MINING CORP.\u000a\u000aHut 8 Mining Corp., headquartered in Toronto, Canada is a cryptocurrency mining and blockchain infrastructure company established through an exclusive arrangement with the Bitfury Group, the world\u2019s leading full-service blockchain technology company.

Statements containing forward-looking information are not historical facts but instead represent management\u2019s expectations, estimates and projections regarding future events.\u000a\u000aForward-looking information is necessarily based on a number of opinions, assumptions and estimates that, while considered reasonable by Hut 8 as of the date of this press release, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information, including but not limited to the factors described in greater detail in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of the Filing Statement relating to the Qualifying Transaction of Oriana Resources Corporation and Hut 8, which is available at www.sedar.com. These factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the factors that could affect Hut 8; however, these factors should be considered carefully. There can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will prove to be correct. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are made as of the date of this press release, and Hut 8 expressly disclaims any obligation to update or alter statements containing any forward-looking information, or the factors or assumptions underlying them, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\u000a\u000a1 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures and consequently, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income and loss presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP financial performance measurement. The Company calculates Adjusted EBITDA by adding back to net income (loss): interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and impairment charges as further adjusted to add back stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is provided to investors to supplement the results of operations reported in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing the Company\u2019s financial results with other companies in the industry, many of which also use Adjusted EBITDA in their communications to investors. By excluding non-cash charges such as amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation and impairment charges, as well as non-operating charges for interest and income taxes, investors can evaluate the Company's operations and its ability to generate cash flows from operations and can compare its results on a more consistent basis to the results of other companies in the industry. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to establish internal budgets and goals, and evaluate performance of its business units and management, and evaluate potential acquisitions. The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important indicator of the Company's operational strength and performance of its business and a useful measure of the Company's historical and prospective operating trends. However, there are significant limitations to the use of Adjusted EBITDA since it excludes interest income and expense and income taxes and non-recurring items such as goodwill impairments, each of which impact the Company's profitability and operating cash flows, as well as depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and stock-based compensation. The Company believes that these limitations are compensated by clearly identifying the difference between the two measures. Adjusted EBITDA as defined by the Company may not be comparable with similarly named measures provided by other entities.

Announces First Quarter 2018 Financial Results</p>\u000a\u000a<p>All Figures in Canadian Dollars Unless Otherwise Noted</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Company raised $70.0 million to fund investment in mining hardware Entered into definitive agreement with the City of Medicine Hat for the supply of 42 MW of electric energy First quarter 2018 revenue of $10,988,949 Strong gross profit margin of 80%, or $8,823,650 (excluding depreciation) Adjusted EBITDA of $7,690,365 828 Bitcoin mined in Q1</p>\u000a\u000a<p>TORONTO, May 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hut 8 Mining Corp. (TSX-V:HUT) (\u201cHut 8\u201d, or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a cryptocurrency mining and blockchain infrastructure company established through an exclusive arrangement with the world\u2019s leading full-service blockchain technology company, the Bitfury Group, is pleased to announce its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 (\u201cQ1 2018\u201d). Hut 8 owns Bitcoin mining datacenters called BlockBoxes that are purchased from the Bitfury Group.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Corporate Update</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Andrew Kiguel, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hut 8, said: \u201cWe are pleased with the progress Hut 8 has made in a very short period of time. Hut 8 began mining on December 22, 2017 with 7 BlockBoxes in Drumheller, Alberta, with power capacity of 7.7 MW, representing 52.5 PH/s. On February 7, 2018, an additional 10 BlockBoxes were added in Drumheller for an aggregate power capacity of 18.7 MW, representing 128 PH/s. Despite the ramp-up period, in Q1 2018 Hut 8 was able to mine a total of 828 Bitcoin. As of May 24, 2018, Hut 8 has mined in excess of 1,300 Bitcoin which we continue to hold.\u201d</p>\u000a\u000a<p>\u201cWe are excited that our data center build-out in the City of Medicine Hat is well underway. We estimate that full-scale production will commence by September 2018. The City of Medicine Hat site will consist of an additional 40 BlockBoxes. Once operational, Hut 8 will own 57 BlockBoxes, representing a 335% increase from current mining capacity, securing our position as one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners in the world, with a total of 66.7 MW of power capacity and 448 PH/s. With this increase in BlockBoxes from 17 to 57, we expect that our daily mining production will increase significantly. We believe our City of Medicine Hat Facility will represent operational excellence and set a new global benchmark for industrial scale cryptocurrency mining operations,\u201d added Kiguel.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Manufactured by the Bitfury Group, the BlockBoxes are regarded as one of the most powerful and cost-effective Bitcoin mining solutions available on the market. The BlockBoxes are based on cutting-edge hardware and software and are fully configurable and upgradeable to the next generation of silicon technology. The efficient design and low operating cost of the BlockBoxes makes Bitcoin mining more productive and affordable. As previously disclosed, Hut 8 has obtained an exclusive right to all Bitfury Group hardware and software solutions, including the BlockBoxes, for cryptocurrency mining within North America.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Q1 2018 Financial Results</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Q1 2018 represented Hut 8\u2019s first full quarter in operations. With a gross profit margin of 80% (excluding depreciation), the Company\u2019s mining cost-per-bitcoin was $2,615 (US$2,028), which compares favorably to the selling price of Bitcoin at the end of Q1 2018, being $8,991.67 (US$6,973.53).</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The Company believes that Hut 8 is amongst the lowest cost miners of Bitcoin in the world. Hut 8 anticipates its cost per Bitcoin to remain competitive, based on the increasing difficulty rate, offset by the City of Medicine Hat site that will operate more efficiently, next generation BlockBoxes, and a benefit from an improved energy contract for the price of electricity over the Drumheller site.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Selected Financial Highlights from Q1 2018</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Revenues of $10,988,949 Gross profit of $8,823,650 (excluding depreciation) EBITDA1 of $1,824,685 and Adjusted EBITDA1 of $7,690,365 Completion of the Company\u2019s \u201cQualifying Transaction\u201d Raised $70.0 million of equity capital to fund investments and growth Cash balance of $23.7 million and working capital of $19.3 million Mined 828 Bitcoin in Q1 2018, bringing total mined since commencing operations on December 21, 2017 to over 1,300 On February 7, 2018, added 10 new operating BlockBox Data Centers for a total of 17 in operation, representing 18.7 MW / 128 PH/s Purchased 40 additional BlockBoxes to be operational by Q3 2018 representing additional 48 MW / 320 PH/s Entered into definitive agreements with the city of Medicine Hat for the supply of 42 MW of electric energy and the lease of land</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Summary of Q1 2018 Financial Results Revenue $ 10,988,949\u000aGross Profit $ 3,183,181\u000aGross Profit % 29%\u000aGross Profit (excluding depreciation) $ 8,823,650\u000aGross Profit % (excluding depreciation) 80%\u000aOperating income $ 218,701\u000aNet Loss $ (3,815,784 ) EBITDA $ 1,824,685\u000aAdjusted EBITDA* $ 7,690,365\u000aLoss per share $ (0.05 ) * EBITDA adjusted for fair value re-measurement of digital assets, listing expense and one time transactional costs.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>As a result of the decrease in the price of Bitcoin in Q1 2018, Hut 8 incurred a $4.1 million non-cash decrease on the re-measurement of the value of Bitcoin in inventory, and consequently, finished the quarter with a net loss of approximately $3.8 million. In future quarters, when revenue is recorded, the Company would expect to see unrealized gains or losses based on the price of Bitcoin on the corresponding reporting date, relative to the price on the day mined.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>This earnings release should be read in conjunction with the Company&#39;s Management Discussion &amp; Analysis, Financial Statements and Notes to Financial Statements for Q1 2018, which have been posted under the Company\u2019s profile on SEDAR at <a href="http://www.sedar.com">www.sedar.com</a> and are also available on the Company&#39;s website at <a href="http://www.hut8mining.com">www.hut8mining.com</a>.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>ABOUT HUT 8 MINING CORP.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Hut 8 Mining Corp., headquartered in Toronto, Canada is a cryptocurrency mining and blockchain infrastructure company established through an exclusive arrangement with the Bitfury Group, the world\u2019s leading full-service blockchain technology company.
